Afghanistan,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from 
Afghanistan. I just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step 
should be. I'm Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing your background ‚Äî that helps a lot. Since you're 16, just Ô¨Ånished primary school
(folkeskolen), and you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you're now at a key crossroads where many options open up
in Denmark. Let me walk you through the main paths, and then I‚Äôll give a recommendation depending a
bit on your interests:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
If you enjoy academic subjects, want to keep your options open for university later, and you‚Äôre good at
studying, this is the classic path.
STX (Alment gymnasium) ‚Äî general upper secondary education; broad, academic focus
(humanities, science, languages, social sciences).
HHX (Handelsskole) ‚Äî focus on business, economics, and international trade.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium) ‚Äî focus on technology, science, and innovation.
HF ‚Äî shorter (2 years), more practical, often used if you prefer not to do 3 years of gymnasium.
‚úÖ Good for you if: you enjoy studying, want many options after, or are unsure what you want yet.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training, EUD)
If you want to get into the workforce earlier, or learn a trade (electrician, carpenter, mechanic,
hairdresser, chef, etc.).
‚úÖ Good for you if: you like hands-on work, want to start earning earlier, and prefer practical learning over
academic study.
Ûæ†∞ EUX (Kombineret erhvervsuddannelse og gymnasial eksamen)
This combines vocational training with a gymnasial education ‚Äî you get both practical skills and the
possibility to study further.
‚úÖ Good for you if: you want a skilled trade but also want to keep university open as an option later.
Ûæ†± International Options
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Since you have an international background and may speak more than one language (perhaps Dari or
Pashto?), you might also consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî English-language upper secondary, recognized internationally.
Language programs ‚Äî focusing on Danish and foreign languages can be valuable.
‚úÖ Good if you're globally minded and want international options.
My recommendation (based on what you told me):
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, Ô¨Ånished folkeskolen, and you have both Danish and Afghan cultural roots,
I would recommend:
STX or HHX if you like academic work and want many future options.
HTX if you are into technology, science, or innovation.
EUX if you like practical work but want a secure path to higher education too.
üëâ If you tell me a bit more ‚Äî for example:
What subjects do you enjoy most?
Do you prefer studying or doing practical work?
Are you thinking about university later?
Any dream jobs?
‚ÄîI can give you a much more speciÔ¨Åc recommendation.

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî it helps a lot.
Since you‚Äôre 16, Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark (probably folkeskole), and are Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you
have several solid options depending on your interests, strengths, and long-term goals. I‚Äôll break it down
simply:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
If you enjoy school subjects and think you might want to go to university later:
STX (Almen Studentereksamen)
Broad academic education (humanities, social sciences, natural sciences).
Good if you‚Äôre not sure exactly what you want yet.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination)
Focus on business, economics, marketing.
Great if you're interested in business, Ô¨Ånance, or starting your own company one day.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination)
Focus on science, technology, IT, engineering.
Good if you like science, tech, or want to go into engineering or IT.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination)
Shorter (2 years), more practical.
Good if you want a faster path to university or professional programs.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you want to start working sooner, learn a trade or a speciÔ¨Åc profession:
For example: electrician, carpenter, mechanic, chef, healthcare assistant, etc.
Many programs combine practical training with some school.
Often strong job security and good salaries after graduation.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Ûæ†∞ Kombination: EUX
If you want both vocational training and the possibility to go to university later:
EUX mixes vocational education with upper secondary academic courses.
Example: you could become a skilled craftsman while also earning a degree that allows you to
apply to university.
More work, but very Ô¨Çexible for the futur e.
Ûæ†± Other options
International Baccalaureate (IB): if you want an international education (especially if you
consider studying abroad one day).
Private schools, business academies, or artistic schools depending on your interests.
My advice:
Since you're young and already bilingual (which is a great strength), I‚Äôd recommend:
If you‚Äôre academically strong: STX or HHX.
If you prefer hands-on learning: EUX or EUD.
If you want something international: IB.
üëâ It also depends on:
Do you enjoy school subjects like math, science, languages, or business?
Do you want to work soon, or study longer?
Are you thinking about university later?

International Baccalaureate (IB): If you like English and want an international option.
Private or specialized schools: e.g. creative schools, sports colleges, etc.

Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have a multicultural background, you could also think about
careers where language and culture are useful: international business, diplomacy, education, etc.
If you enjoy school and want as many options as possible later, STX or HHX are often safe choices.

Your main options after primary school:

HHX (business-oriented) ‚Äî more focused on business, economics, and international studies.

Good if you already know you want to enter a trade or technical Ô¨Åeld (e.g. electrician, carpenter,

Leads directly to the job market but can also open doors to further education.
Ûæ†∞ Other special programs:
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî if you want a more international proÔ¨Åle (can be useful later if

If you‚Äôre interested in business, economics, or entrepreneurship ‚Üí  HHX.

‚úÖ Consider IB if you have strong English skills and might want to study internationally later.
‚úÖ If you're unsure and want to explore personal development before choosing, efterskole can be a

Antigua and Barbuda,"Uddannelsesmuligheder efter folkeskolen
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Antigua 
and Barbuda. I just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step 
should be. I'm Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. You're actually in a pretty strong position:
you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you have a multicultural background (which can open up a lot of opportunities),
and you're at the perfect age to start thinking carefully about your futur e.
Let‚Äôs break it down step by step.
The Danish system ‚Äî your main options now
After Ô¨Ånishing primary school (folkeskolen, 9th or 10th grade), you usually have a few main options:
1. Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad academic education, good if you're not 100% sure yet
and want many doors open (university, business, health, humanities, etc.).
HHX (Handelsskole): Focus on business, economics, international trade ‚Äî great if you're
interested in business or entrepreneurship.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): More technical and science-oriented (technology, IT, engineering,
natural sciences).
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter, more practice-oriented, often used if you
want to enter certain professions more quickly.
2. Erhvervsuddannelse (VET - vocational education)
If you‚Äôre more hands-on or want to start a career early (crafts, trades, culinary, health care
assistant, IT-support, etc.).
3. International education
International Baccalaureate (IB), if you want an internationally recognized diploma and
consider studying or working abroad someday.
A few personal recommendations for you
Because you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born in Denmark, but with roots from Antigua and Barbuda ‚Äî you have
an international proÔ¨Åle that can give you an edge.
If you enjoy academics and want to keep your options open:
üëâ STX or IB would be very strong choices.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2If you're interested in business or global trade:
üëâ HHX could Ô¨Åt well.
If you‚Äôre into technology, IT, engineering, or natural sciences:
üëâ HTX would be very relevant.
If you prefer practical, job-oriented education:
üëâ VET could get you working earlier with specialized skills.
Long-term thinking
You might also think about:
Do you see yourself studying at university later?
Do you enjoy languages, travel, and international work?
Are you more hands-on or more theory-oriented?
Are there subjects you particularly enjoy right now?
My personal advice (based on what you've told me)
Since you‚Äôre still young and may want to keep doors open, STX or IB might be the strongest starting
point. You can specialize later, and your international background could help you a lot if you go for IB.
But if you already know that, for example, you love business or technology, then HHX or HTX could be
better.
If you want, you can tell me a bit more (e.g. your interests, subjects you like, dreams for the futur e) ‚Äî
and I can give you a more personal recommendation. Shall we?

If you're aiming for university later, gymnasium is the typical path. There are diÔ¨Äerent types depending

Great if you're not sure yet.

‚úÖ Best if: You want to keep doors open for university or higher education in Denmark or abroad.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (VET / vocational training) ‚Äî practical route
If you prefer hands-on learning and want to get a job more quickly, vocational education might be a
great option.
Examples: electrician, carpenter, chef, healthcare assistant, IT-supporter, etc.
You can still continue later to higher education via EUX (a combined vocational + academic route).
‚úÖ Best if: You like working with your hands or want a clear profession early.
Ûæ†∞ International education
Since you have Argentinian roots and are multilingual, you might also consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî international diploma, opens doors worldwide.

When to choose:
If you want to keep your options open for university later.
If you enjoy academic subjects (science, languages, business, or social studies).

chef, etc.).
Pros:
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2You can enter the workforce faster.
Many vocational programs in Denmark combine school with paid apprenticeship.
Ûæ†∞ International Options
Because you have an Armenian background and speak Danish Ô¨Çuently, you may have a small advantage
if you want to pursue international studies later on. You could even consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB)
Boarding schools (Efterskole for a year, if you haven't done it yet)
Exchange programs
Ûæ†± Efterskole (Optional gap year type)
When to choose:
If you want to spend a year Ô¨Åguring things out while still being in school.
If you want to build conÔ¨Ådence, meet new people, or improve skills (languages, sports, arts, etc.).
Quick self-check questions:
Do you enjoy academic schoolwork? ‚Üí  Consider STX, HHX, HTX or IB
Do you prefer practical, hands-on work? ‚Üí  Consider EUD
Are you unsure and want more time to explore? ‚Üí  Consider Efterskole or HF
My general advice to you:
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you have full access to the Danish education system. If you're not sure yet
what you want to do, STX or HF is usually a safe choice because they give you a broad education and
keep your doors open for both university and vocational paths later.

STX (Almen studentereksamen / General upper secondary school)
Broad academic education (sciences, humanities, social sciences, languages).
Prepares you for university.
Good if you‚Äôre not sure yet exactly what you want, but want to keep your options open.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination)
Focus on business, economics, and international trade.
Could be a great option, especially if you're interested in something international, and your

HTX (Higher Technical Examination)
Focus on natural sciences, technology, IT.
Ideal if you like technical Ô¨Åelds or plan on engineering, IT, etc.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination)
A bit shorter (2 years instead of 3).
More practically oriented.
Good if you want a more Ô¨Çexible, less theoretical approach.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (VET - Vocational Education and Training)
Combines school and practical training.
Good if you want to get into a trade, craft, or speciÔ¨Åc profession (plumber, carpenter, chef,
hairdresser, IT-supporter, etc.).

How to decide?

Do you prefer practical, hands-on learning? ‚Üí  VET programs.
Are you more into business, economy, or global trade? ‚Üí  HHX or IB.

This is usually the most common next step for students after 9th or 10th grade.
STX (Almen studentereksamen / General upper secondary school)
Broad academic education (sciences, humanities, social sciences, languages).
Prepares you for university.
Good if you‚Äôre not sure yet exactly what you want, but want to keep your options open.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination)
Focus on business, economics, and international trade.
Could be a great option, especially if you're interested in something international, and your
Austrian background might Ô¨Åt nicely here.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination)
Focus on natural sciences, technology, IT.
Ideal if you like technical Ô¨Åelds or plan on engineering, IT, etc.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination)
A bit shorter (2 years instead of 3).
More practically oriented.
Good if you want a more Ô¨Çexible, less theoretical approach.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (VET - Vocational Education and Training)
Combines school and practical training.
Good if you want to get into a trade, craft, or speciÔ¨Åc profession (plumber, carpenter, chef,
hairdresser, IT-supporter, etc.).
Denmark has a strong apprenticeship system, and many industries are looking for skilled people.
Ûæ†∞ Other paths
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî international upper secondary program in English.
Good if you see yourself studying or working internationally.
Also Ô¨Åts well with your Austrian-Danish background.
Folk High Schools (H√∏jskole) / Efterskole (for a year) ‚Äî if you want a gap year to develop
personally before choosing.
How to decide?
Here are some questions you can ask yourself:
Do you enjoy academic studies and theory? ‚Üí  Gymnasiale uddannelser.
Do you prefer practical, hands-on learning? ‚Üí  VET programs.
Are you more into business, economy, or global trade? ‚Üí  HHX or IB.
Do you like technology, science, IT? ‚Üí  HTX.
Are you unsure and want to keep your doors open? ‚Üí  STX or IB.
My neutral recommendation (based on what you‚Äôve told me so far):
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish, have international roots, and are at the start of your decision process, STX
or IB could be strong starting points ‚Äî they keep a lot of doors open for university or vocational choices
later.
If you already know you're interested in business or technology, then HHX or HTX might Ô¨Åt even better.
üëâ If you tell me a little more ‚Äî for example:
What subjects you enjoy.
Whether you see yourself studying at university or starting work earlier.
If you like practical or theoretical learning more.
‚Äî I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.
Shall we go one step deeper?

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. You're actually in a really good position:

Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (General Upper Secondary Education ‚Äî STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
This is the most common next step for many Danish students.
STX (Almen studentereksamen)
Focus on general academic subjects: languages, science, social studies, arts, etc.
Good if you‚Äôre not sure exactly what you want yet, and want broad access to university later.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination Programme)
Focus on business, economics, marketing, international trade.
Good if you're interested in business or international careers (your bilingual background could be
useful here).
HTX (Higher Technical Examination Programme)
Focus on science, technology, IT, and engineering.
Good if you enjoy math, tech, or want to work in engineering, IT, or science.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination)
Shorter, 2-year program, often for more practical or Ô¨Çexible routes to higher education.
Ûæ†Ø EUD or EUX (Vocational Education and Training)

You learn a speciÔ¨Åc trade or profession (mechanic, electrician, hairdresser, carpenter, chef, etc.)
EUX allows you to combine vocational training with subjects that give you access to higher
education.
Good if you prefer more hands-on learning and want to enter the job market faster.

should be. I'm Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing ‚Äî you're in quite a good position actually: you're young, you‚Äôre bilingual (Danish +
likely English from your Bahamian background), and you‚Äôve Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark.
Now, in Denmark, after primary school (folkeskole), you have several options depending a bit on your
interests, strengths, and long-term goals. Let me break it down for you:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper secondary education)
If you want a more academic path that keeps your options open for university later:
a. STX (Almen studentereksamen)
Broad, general education (humanities, sciences, social sciences).
Great if you‚Äôre not yet sure exactly what you want.
Good preparation for university.

supporter, etc.
With EUX, you combine vocational training with some academic courses, so you can still go to
university later if you want.
Ûæ†∞ International options
Since you have Bahamian roots and may speak English well:
International Baccalaureate (IB): English-language upper secondary education, accepted
worldwide.
Great if you consider studying abroad in the futur e.
IB programs exist in Denmark as well.
My personal recommendation (since you asked)
Since you're bilingual, with an international background, and just 16:
If you're academically strong: STX or IB could be very good.
If you‚Äôre business-oriented or globally-minded: HHX or IB.

If you‚Äôre more practically-oriented: EUX vocational track.

education system and what could Ô¨Åt depending on your interests.
Ûæ†Æ First, a quick overview of your main options after folkeskolen:
Path Description Good for...
Gymnasiale uddannelser
(Upper secondary school)3-year academic programs
that prepare for universityIf you enjoy academic subjects, want broad
knowledge, or are aiming for university.
Erhvervsuddannelser
(Vocational education)2-5 year programs that
combine school +
apprenticeshipIf you prefer practical skills, want to start
working sooner, or have a trade/profession
in mind.
Kombinerede forl√∏b (EUX)Combines vocational training
with academic studiesIf you want both hands-on training and the
option to continue studying later.
Ûæ†Ø Some questions to help narrow down the path:
Do you enjoy theoretical/academic subjects (math, history, languages, etc)?
Or do you prefer practical work (mechanics, design, IT, hospitality, etc)?
Are you thinking about university or more about getting a job and earning earlier?
Do you want to study in Denmark only, or consider international opportunities (Barbados, EU, etc)?
Ûæ†∞ Example paths depending on your interests:
If you like school and want to keep your options open ‚Üí  STX, HHX or HTX
STX (Almen gymnasium): Broad academic education (Danish, science, languages, humanities).
HHX: Focus on business, economics, and languages.
HTX: Focus on technology, science, IT.
If you want to work with your hands or have a trade ‚Üí  Erhvervsuddannelse
Examples: electrician, carpenter, chef, IT-supporter, healthcare worker.
Denmark has excellent apprenticeship programs and strong job markets for many trades.

You get both vocational training and the right to enter university.
Very good if you're unsure and want to keep doors open.
Ûæ†± As a young person with a Caribbean background
Sometimes having an international identity opens extra opportunities:
Consider learning more languages (English you likely already know, but maybe Spanish, French, or
German).
Denmark also oÔ¨Äers international programs (IB - International Baccalaureate) if you want an
international environment.

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. Since you‚Äôre 16, Ô¨Ånished primary school (I
assume you mean folkeskolen), and you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, let‚Äôs talk about your options in Denmark‚Äôs
education system and what could Ô¨Åt depending on your interests.
Ûæ†Æ First, a quick overview of your main options after folkeskolen:
Path Description Good for...
Gymnasiale uddannelser
(Upper secondary school)3-year academic programs
that prepare for universityIf you enjoy academic subjects, want broad
knowledge, or are aiming for university.
Erhvervsuddannelser
(Vocational education)2-5 year programs that
combine school +
apprenticeshipIf you prefer practical skills, want to start
working sooner, or have a trade/profession
in mind.
Kombinerede forl√∏b (EUX)Combines vocational training
with academic studiesIf you want both hands-on training and the
option to continue studying later.
Ûæ†Ø Some questions to help narrow down the path:
Do you enjoy theoretical/academic subjects (math, history, languages, etc)?
Or do you prefer practical work (mechanics, design, IT, hospitality, etc)?
Are you thinking about university or more about getting a job and earning earlier?
Do you want to study in Denmark only, or consider international opportunities (Barbados, EU, etc)?
Ûæ†∞ Example paths depending on your interests:
If you like school and want to keep your options open ‚Üí  STX, HHX or HTX
STX (Almen gymnasium): Broad academic education (Danish, science, languages, humanities).
HHX: Focus on business, economics, and languages.
HTX: Focus on technology, science, IT.
If you want to work with your hands or have a trade ‚Üí  Erhvervsuddannelse
Examples: electrician, carpenter, chef, IT-supporter, healthcare worker.
Denmark has excellent apprenticeship programs and strong job markets for many trades.
If you want a mix ‚Üí  EUX
You get both vocational training and the right to enter university.
Very good if you're unsure and want to keep doors open.
Ûæ†± As a young person with a Caribbean background
Sometimes having an international identity opens extra opportunities:
Consider learning more languages (English you likely already know, but maybe Spanish, French, or
German).
Denmark also oÔ¨Äers international programs (IB - International Baccalaureate) if you want an
international environment.
Later you could study or work in both Denmark and Barbados/the Caribbean/EU.
Ûæ†≤ My personal recommendation (based on limited info so far):
If you're academically strong and unsur e, STX or EUX would be a safe and Ô¨Çexible choice.

If you are very business-minded, HHX could be perfect.

Belarus,"Uddannelsesvalg efter folkeskolen
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Belarus. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Very good question ‚Äî and it's great that you're already thinking seriously about your next steps. Since
you're 16, just Ô¨Ånished primary school (I'm assuming folkeskole or equivalent), and you're Ô¨Çuent in
Danish, you have several options in Denmark. I‚Äôll walk you through some common pathways depending
a bit on your interests, skills, and futur e ambitions:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
If you're academically inclined or still unsur e about your futur e job, this is often a good next step.
Options:
STX (Almen Studentereksamen): The most general upper secondary education. Broad subjects:
humanities, sciences, social sciences, languages. Good if you want to keep many options open for
university.
HHX (H√∏jere Handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, marketing, and international
trade. Great if you see yourself in business or Ô¨Ånance.
HTX (H√∏jere Teknisk Eksamen): Focus on science, technology, IT, and engineering. Very good if
you're interested in tech, IT, natural sciences.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter (2 years), more practical, good if you want
university later but not a 3-year gymnasium.
üß≠ Who this is good for:
If you're academic, enjoy school, and want to keep your options open for university or higher education
later.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you're more hands-on and want to get into a trade or profession fairly quickly.
Examples:
Electrician
Carpenter
IT support
Chef
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Hairdresser
Mechanic
Health care assistant
You combine school and apprenticeship (praktik), and after 3-4 years you are fully qualiÔ¨Åed for work.
üß≠ Who this is good for:
If you enjoy practical work and want to start a career faster, maybe earning money earlier.
Ûæ†∞ EUX (Combination of vocational and academic)
A combination where you get both a vocational qualiÔ¨Åcation and a studentereksamen level exam, so you
can go to university afterwards.
üß≠ Who this is good for:
If you want both practical skills and the option to study further.
Ûæ†± Other options
Efterskole or h√∏jskole (1-year personal development schools) if you want a ""gap year""
experience while still learning.
International programs if you are interested in studying in English or later studying abroad.
Since your parents are from Belarus:
You may also have language skills (Russian, Belarusian) that could be useful in certain careers:
international business, translation, diplomacy, IT companies, etc.
My advice in short:
If you‚Äôre academic ‚Üí  STX / HHX / HTX
If you‚Äôre practical ‚Üí  EUD or EUX
If you‚Äôre unsure ‚Üí  STX is the safest and most Ô¨Çexible
üëâ If you tell me a bit more ‚Äî for example:
Your interests (science? business? creative? IT? something else?)
Whether you like school / studying
Whether you want to go to university or start work earlier

Focus on technology, science, and innovation.
Good if you like STEM subjects: math, chemistry, IT, engineering, etc.
IB (International Baccalaureate):
International, English-language program.
Very good if you may consider studying abroad later.
Denmark has IB schools (especially in larger cities).
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET)
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2If you're more interested in practical work, earning money earlier, or have a speciÔ¨Åc trade you‚Äôre

You can learn a trade (carpentry, electrician, chef, healthcare assistant, mechanic, etc.).

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that actually helps me give you a much more useful

main options in Denmark and add a bit of guidance based on your situation:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (General upper secondary education)
This is a great choice if you're still not sure exactly what you want to do yet, or if you're considering
higher education later (university, professionsh√∏jskole, etc.).
STX (Studentereksamen): Broad, academic, with both sciences, humanities, and social sciences.

Might Ô¨Åt well if you're interested in business or want to connect with Belize's international aspects.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination): Focus on technology, science, IT, and engineering.

Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education and training)
If you already know you want a practical profession and maybe start working sooner, you can take an
EUD or EUX:
EUD (Vocational): Trains you for a speciÔ¨Åc job (e.g. electrician, carpenter, chef, hairdresser, social

International education (IB - International Baccalaureate): Some Danish schools oÔ¨Äer the IB.
This is in English and internationally recognized ‚Äî could be very valuable with your international

Private schools / international colleges: A few private options exist if you want a very diÔ¨Äerent

In Denmark, it's very normal to take a 10. klasse year if you want some extra time to decide or
strengthen your academic level before starting youth education.

Bhutan,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Bhuta n. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about your background ‚Äî that's very helpful. Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished
primary school in Denmark (which usually means you‚Äôve completed 9th or 10th grade, depending on
your situation), you‚Äôre at a very important decision point. The Danish education system oÔ¨Äers several
good paths, depending on your interests, strengths, and what you want for your futur e.
Let me give you a few options, depending a bit on who you are and what your goals might be:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, or HF)
If you‚Äôre aiming for university in the future.
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and you‚Äôve grown up in Denmark, this path might be very natural.
STX (Alment Gymnasium): Focus on general academic subjects (Danish, English, history, math,
sciences, languages, etc.).
HHX: If you like business, economics, marketing.
HTX: If you like technical subjects, science, IT, technology.
HF: A slightly shorter and more practically oriented version (2 years) that still gives access to higher
education.
üëâ Good if: You like academic subjects, want to keep doors open for university, and aren‚Äôt sure exactly
what you want yet.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (EUD / EUX - vocational education)
If you‚Äôre more practical, want to get a job sooner, or like learning by doing.
You combine school with apprenticeship in a company (praktikplads).
Many options: electrician, carpenter, IT supporter, hairdresser, chef, healthcare worker, etc.
EUX allows you to combine vocational training with general upper secondary education, so you still
keep the door open to university.
üëâ Good if: You enjoy practical work, want job skills quickly, but might also want the option to study
more later.
Ûæ†∞ International or specialized education
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2If you are considering international opportunities or want something a bit diÔ¨Äerent.
International Baccalaureate (IB), which is oÔ¨Äered in Denmark.
Could also consider private schools with international focus.
üëâ Good if: You speak good English, might want to study abroad one day, or want a more global
education.
Ûæ†± Take a pause (10th grade, efterskole, h√∏jskole)
Many Danish students take an extra year after primary school.
You can go to 10th grade, efterskole (boarding school with focus on personal development, sports,
arts, etc.), or h√∏jskole (for young adults, often after gymnasium).
üëâ Good if: You want to mature a bit more, explore interests, make new friends, or need a bit more time
to decide.
My advice:
Since you‚Äôre only 16 and Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you have a lot of doors open. If you enjoy school, STX, HHX or
HTX might be a very safe and Ô¨Çexible option. If you‚Äôre more practical or want a job sooner, EUD/EUX is
excellent and highly respected in Denmark. And if you‚Äôre not sure yet, an efterskole or 10th grade can be
a great place to grow.
üëâ If you tell me a bit more:
What are your favorite subjects?
Do you prefer more theory or practical work?
Are you thinking about university?
Do you have any dreams (doctor, engineer, business, IT, crafts, etc)?

Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. You‚Äôre actually at a really good point right
now, because Denmark oÔ¨Äers quite a few options after primary school (9th or 10th grade). Since you're
Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have your roots both in Denmark and Bolivia, you have even more opportunities.
Let‚Äôs go through the main options ‚Äî and I‚Äôll give you a bit of personal advice depending on your
interests.
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These are great if you want to keep many doors open for higher education later.
STX (Alment gymnasium): Broad academic focus: languages, social sciences, natural sciences,
arts.
Good if you're not yet sure what you want to study.
Gives you access to all university programs.
HHX (Handelsskole): Focus on business, economics, international trade.
Great if you're interested in business, marketing, or Ô¨Ånance.
Also excellent if you might someday work internationally (your Bolivian roots could be an
asset here).
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technology, natural sciences, IT.
Good if you enjoy subjects like math, physics, chemistry, biology, or programming.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): More practically oriented, 2-year program.
Good if you want a shorter academic program, or if you're considering speciÔ¨Åc professional
Ô¨Åelds afterward.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education and training / EUD)
If you want to get more hands-on experience and go directly into a trade or profession (e.g.
electrician, carpenter, healthcare worker, IT supporter).
You get a mix of school and apprenticeship (praktikplads).
Very solid job opportunities afterward, and you can still build further education on top if you want.
Ûæ†∞ International possibilities
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Since you have Bolivian roots and are Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you could also consider eventua lly studying
or working abroad. Starting with a gymnasium program with strong language components (e.g.
STX with Spanish or English focus, or even IB ‚Äî International Baccalaureate if oÔ¨Äered near you)
might be a very strong foundation.
My general recommendation for you:
If you're not fully sure yet:
STX is usually a very safe and Ô¨Çexible option. It keeps all your doors open for university and
lets you explore diÔ¨Äerent areas.
If you‚Äôre more into business and languages:
HHX might be a great Ô¨Åt, especially if you think about working internationally one day.
If you're into science, technology or engineering:
HTX could be ideal.
If you prefer a practical job early, and like working hands-on:
EUD is a very good route, especially in Denmark where vocational training is highly respected.
üëâ A small personal tip:
Since you're bilingual (Danish + likely Spanish) and live in Denmark, your language skills are a big
advantage. Many companies and organizations value people who can work across cultures and
languages ‚Äî you might want to keep that in mind whatever path you pick.
If you tell me a bit more ‚Äî for example:

Brazil,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Brazil. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing ‚Äî that helps a lot. You're in a really good position, actually: Ô¨Çuent in Danish, with
a multicultural background, and about to make your Ô¨Årst bigger educational decision.
Let‚Äôs break it down carefully. In Denmark, after primary school (folkeskole), you usually have a few typical
options depending on your interests and goals:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
This is the most common route if you're aiming for higher education later (university, professional
bachelor's, etc.)
STX (Alment gymnasium)
Broad, academic, general education. Good if you're still Ô¨Åguring out what you want, or if you're
interested in subjects like languages, history, science, or social studies.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium)
Business and economics-focused. Great if you‚Äôre interested in international business, trade,
marketing, or Ô¨Ånance ‚Äî your Brazilian background could be an extra advantage here.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium)
Focus on technology, natural sciences, IT, and engineering. Strong if you're into science, tech, or
want a more hands-on approach.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
A shorter, 2-year program. Often used if you want a quicker path to certain professions or higher
education but prefer a bit less theoretical work.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education and Training, VET / EUD)
More practical, job-oriented education that leads directly to trades or professions (electrician,
carpenter, chef, IT-support, etc.).
Can be combined with EUX if you want both a vocational diploma and the possibility to continue to
higher education later.
Ûæ†∞ Other paths:
Efterskole or H√∏jskole (1-year schools for personal development)
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî if you‚Äôre very internationally minded.
Some thoughts based on your background:
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you're very Ô¨Çexible in the Danish system.
Your Brazilian background might give you an edge if you want to work internationally or study
business, languages, diplomacy, or law.
If you‚Äôre not sure yet: STX is the safest general option and keeps most doors open.
If you like business or economics: HHX could be a very smart choice.
If you like technology, science, or engineering: HTX is excellent.
If you prefer hands-on learning: EUD/EUX could be great.
üëâ My personal recommendation (based on what you've shared):

Thank you for sharing ‚Äî that helps a lot. You're in a really good position, actually: Ô¨Çuent in Danish, with
a multicultural background, and about to make your Ô¨Årst bigger educational decision.
Let‚Äôs break it down carefully. In Denmark, after primary school (folkeskole), you usually have a few typical
options depending on your interests and goals:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
This is the most common route if you're aiming for higher education later (university, professional
bachelor's, etc.)
STX (Alment gymnasium)
Broad, academic, general education. Good if you're still Ô¨Åguring out what you want, or if you're
interested in subjects like languages, history, science, or social studies.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium)
Business and economics-focused. Great if you‚Äôre interested in international business, trade,
marketing, or Ô¨Ånance ‚Äî your Brazilian background could be an extra advantage here.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium)
Focus on technology, natural sciences, IT, and engineering. Strong if you're into science, tech, or
want a more hands-on approach.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
A shorter, 2-year program. Often used if you want a quicker path to certain professions or higher
education but prefer a bit less theoretical work.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education and Training, VET / EUD)
More practical, job-oriented education that leads directly to trades or professions (electrician,
carpenter, chef, IT-support, etc.).
Can be combined with EUX if you want both a vocational diploma and the possibility to continue to
higher education later.
Ûæ†∞ Other paths:
Efterskole or H√∏jskole (1-year schools for personal development)
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî if you‚Äôre very internationally minded.
Some thoughts based on your background:
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you're very Ô¨Çexible in the Danish system.
Your Brazilian background might give you an edge if you want to work internationally or study
business, languages, diplomacy, or law.
If you‚Äôre not sure yet: STX is the safest general option and keeps most doors open.
If you like business or economics: HHX could be a very smart choice.
If you like technology, science, or engineering: HTX is excellent.
If you prefer hands-on learning: EUD/EUX could be great.
üëâ My personal recommendation (based on what you've shared):
STX or HHX, unless you have a very clear technical or vocational interest.
This way, you keep the most options open and can always specialize later.
If you tell me a little more ‚Äî like your interests (math, languages, business, technology, people, etc.) ‚Äî I

Brunei Darussalam,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Brunei 
Darussalam. I just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step 
should be. I'm Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî you're in a really exciting place in life right now. Since
you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and you're 16, that suggests you may have followed a
slightly diÔ¨Äerent educational route, but no problem ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down.
In Denmark, after primary school (folkeskole), most students choose one of these main options:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, or HF)
This is the most common next step if you're aiming for further education later:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): General academic upper secondary school. Very broad ‚Äî good
if you're not sure yet exactly what you want to study later. Prepares you well for university.
HHX (Handelsskole): Focus on business, economics, and international trade ‚Äî especially useful if
you're interested in business, economics, or management.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technical subjects, science, and technology ‚Äî good if you're
interested in engineering, IT, or science.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter (2 years), more practical, also gives university
access.
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you're well-positioned for any of these.
If you don‚Äôt yet know what you want to do later: STX is usually the safest, most Ô¨Çexible option.
Ûæ†Ø Vocational Education (EUD/EUX)
If you're more hands-on and want to enter the workforce earlier while still having the option for further
studies:
EUD: Apprenticeships in areas like carpentry, electrician work, hospitality, etc.
EUX: Combines vocational training with academic courses, giving you a hybrid diploma that allows
for both work and university later.
Ûæ†∞ International Options
Since you have Bruneian roots and speak multiple languages, you might also consider:
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2International Baccalaureate (IB): An international diploma taught in English. Recognized
worldwide, including in Denmark.
International schools: If you're thinking about studying abroad later, this could prepare you well.
Ûæ†± Special Consideration: Your Bruneian Background
Depending on your family's long-term plans:
If you might study or work in Brunei or Southeast Asia one day, it could be helpful to pick studies
that include international business, languages, or intercultural communication.
Denmark has many globalized educational tracks that could Ô¨Åt this nicely.
My personal suggestion (based on what you‚Äôve told me)
If you're unsure right now, STX or IB would give you the most Ô¨Çexibility. They open doors to many
diÔ¨Äerent careers and let you Ô¨Ånd your interests along the way. You‚Äôre still young ‚Äî it‚Äôs okay not to know
yet.
üëâ If you tell me a bit more (for example:
Do you like science, business, languages, or something else?
Do you think you want to go to university someday?
Do you want to stay in Denmark or consider studying abroad?)
... then I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.

you have several options depending a bit on your interests, strengths, and long-term goals. I'll break it
down simply:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (General upper secondary education)
If you're not 100% sure yet what career you want, but you enjoy academic subjects and might want to go
to university later, this is often a good choice.
STX (Almen studentereksamen)
Focus: broad academic education ‚Äî languages, science, humanities, social science.
Good if you want to keep many doors open.
HHX (Handelsgymnasiet)
Focus: business, economics, marketing, international trade.
Good if you're interested in business, Ô¨Ånance, or entrepreneurship.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium)
Focus: technology, science, IT, engineering.
Good if you're into STEM Ô¨Åelds (engineering, IT, natural sciences).
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
Shorter (2 years).
More practice-oriented, but still gives university access.
Often good if you prefer a more mature study environment or want a shorter academic path.
Ûæ†Ø EUD / EUX (Vocational education and training)
If you would prefer something more hands-on and career-oriented directly after primary school:
EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse)
You learn a trade, e.g. electrician, mechanic, hairdresser, chef, carpenter, etc.
You combine school with apprenticeship.
EUX
Combines vocational training with academic courses ‚Äî you get both a trade qualiÔ¨Åcation and a
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2higher education entrance qualiÔ¨Åcation.
Very strong option if you want practical skills but still want the option to continue studying later.
Ûæ†∞ Special options based on your background
Since your family is from Cabo Verde, you may also have unique language and cultural skills that could
be valuable in:
International business
Tourism
Translation/interpreting
Diplomacy / international relations
If you develop those interests, certain paths (HHX, STX with languages, or even EUX) could be especially
useful.
Ûæ†± My personal recommendation based on what you've told me:
Since you‚Äôre still quite open, Ô¨Çuent in Danish, and have an international background, I would probably
recommend:
üëâ STX or HHX ‚Äî unless you‚Äôre already strongly leaning towards a practical trade.
If you like subjects like languages, history, social science: STX.
If you like business, economics, entrepreneurship: HHX.
Both give you broad options for university later.
üëâ If you tell me a little more about your interests, I can make the recommendation even more
tailored for you. For example:
Do you like working with people, num bers, technology, or creativity?
Do you imagine studying at university later?
Do you want to start working as soon as possible?
Would you like me to help you map a few possible ""life paths"" depending on your interests?

Denmark, 16, Ô¨Ånished primary school, Ô¨Çuent in Danish, and at an important turning point, let‚Äôs look at
your realistic options and what might Ô¨Åt depending on your interests:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF) ‚Äî If you want broad options later
STX (Almen studentereksamen): A general academic upper secondary education with a broad
range of subjects: humanities, sciences, and social sciences. Perfect if you're not sure yet and want
to keep all doors open (university, professional studies etc.).
HHX (Handelsgymnasium): Focuses more on business, economics, and international subjects.
Very good if you‚Äôre interested in business, marketing, or Ô¨Ånance.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Technical and science-focused. Ideal if you like technology,
engineering, IT, or natural sciences.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter (2 years). More practical and Ô¨Çexible. Can be a
good path if you want to move on to professional studies or need a less theoretical option.

Like a mix of theoretical and practical learning.
Ûæ†Ø EUD / EUX ‚Äî Vocational education (Erhvervsuddannelse) ‚Äî If you want to work

EUD: Direct vocational education. You get a skilled trade and can start working sooner (e.g.
electrician, carpenter, chef, hairdresser, healthcare assistant, etc.)
EUX: Combines vocational training with a studentereksamen level, so you can both get a
profession and still have the option for further studies later.
‚úÖ Good if you:

secondary education.
‚úÖ Good if you:

International business
Development studies
Global politics or African studies
This could be a strength if you one day want to work internationally, in diplomacy, NGOs, or global
companies.

Very good if you‚Äôre interested in business, marketing, or Ô¨Ånance.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Technical and science-focused. Ideal if you like technology,
engineering, IT, or natural sciences.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter (2 years). More practical and Ô¨Çexible. Can be a
good path if you want to move on to professional studies or need a less theoretical option.
‚úÖ Good if you:
Enjoy school
Want access to universities or higher education
Like a mix of theoretical and practical learning.
Ûæ†Ø EUD / EUX ‚Äî Vocational education (Erhvervsuddannelse) ‚Äî If you want to work
sooner
EUD: Direct vocational education. You get a skilled trade and can start working sooner (e.g.
electrician, carpenter, chef, hairdresser, healthcare assistant, etc.)
EUX: Combines vocational training with a studentereksamen level, so you can both get a
profession and still have the option for further studies later.
‚úÖ Good if you:
Prefer practical, hands-on work.
Want a skilled job with good employment opportunities.
Like learning by doing rather than pure theory.
Ûæ†∞ 10th grade (10. klasse) ‚Äî If you're unsure
Some people choose to take a year in 10th grade to mature, explore options, and get ready for upper
secondary education.
‚úÖ Good if you:
Feel like you need a bit more time to Ô¨Ågure out what you want.
Want to strengthen your grades and skills.
Ûæ†± Special focus: language & international opportunities
Since you also have cultural roots in Central African Republic, later in your studies you might consider:
Languages
International business
Development studies
Global politics or African studies
This could be a strength if you one day want to work internationally, in diplomacy, NGOs, or global
companies.
üëâ My honest advice:
Since you're still very young and have strong language skills in Danish, I would recommend starting with
STX, HHX, HTX or HF ‚Äî depending on your interests ‚Äî to keep as many doors open as possible.
If you already have a strong interest in a trade or profession, EUX is an excellent option too.
If you tell me a bit more about:
What subjects you like (math, science, languages, business, etc.)
If you prefer theory or practical work
If you plan to go to university or work sooner
‚Ä¶then I can give you a much more personalized recommendation. Shall we?

Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education - general academic path)
If you're generally good at school and like academic subjects, this could be a strong path. There are
several types:
STX (Studentereksamen) ‚Äì broad academic education (good if you're not sure yet what you want
to study later).
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination) ‚Äì more focused on business, economics, and
international studies.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination) ‚Äì science, technology, and innovation.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination) ‚Äì shorter, more practically oriented academic program
(usually 2 years).
‚úÖ Why choose this?
Keeps many doors open for university later.
Good if you enjoy theoretical learning.
Gives you time to explore your interests.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET)
If you prefer a more practical, hands-on education, this is a very solid path. You can train for many
professions (electrician, carpenter, IT support, healthcare worker, chef, etc.).
‚úÖ Why choose this?
You get real work experience early.
You can still continue to higher education later if you wish (e.g. erhvervsakademi or
professionsbachelor).
High demand for skilled workers in Denmark.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Ûæ†∞ EUX (Combination of VET + Academic Education)
This combines vocational training with academic subjects so you get both a vocational qualiÔ¨Åcation and
the right to apply for higher education.
‚úÖ Why choose this?
Good if you want both practical experience and the option for university later.
Popular for people who want Ô¨Çexibility.
Ûæ†± Other options (if relevant):
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äì if you're very strong academically and interested in an
international environment.
10th grade (10. klasse) ‚Äì if you need one more year to decide, strengthen your grades, or explore
diÔ¨Äerent subjects.
Some personal advice:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have a multicultural background, you might later consider careers
where language, culture, or international experience matter (business, diplomacy, international
relations, education, etc.)
Denmark is quite strong in trades, technology, healthcare, and green energy ‚Äî futur e-proof areas
worth considering.
Don‚Äôt be afraid to talk to your school counselor (UU-vejleder) ‚Äî they can guide you based on your
speciÔ¨Åc grades, interests, and local options.

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî you're at a very important point in your life right now, so
it's great that you're thinking carefully about your next step. Since you just Ô¨Ånished primary school in
Denmark, your next move will typically be into one of Denmark‚Äôs youth education programs. I‚Äôll try to
give you a few options depending on your interests, strengths, and futur e plans.
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education - general academic path)
If you're generally good at school and like academic subjects, this could be a strong path. There are
several types:
STX (Studentereksamen) ‚Äì broad academic education (good if you're not sure yet what you want
to study later).
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination) ‚Äì more focused on business, economics, and
international studies.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination) ‚Äì science, technology, and innovation.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination) ‚Äì shorter, more practically oriented academic program
(usually 2 years).
‚úÖ Why choose this?
Keeps many doors open for university later.
Good if you enjoy theoretical learning.
Gives you time to explore your interests.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET)
If you prefer a more practical, hands-on education, this is a very solid path. You can train for many
professions (electrician, carpenter, IT support, healthcare worker, chef, etc.).
‚úÖ Why choose this?
You get real work experience early.
You can still continue to higher education later if you wish (e.g. erhvervsakademi or
professionsbachelor).
High demand for skilled workers in Denmark.
Ûæ†∞ EUX (Combination of VET + Academic Education)
This combines vocational training with academic subjects so you get both a vocational qualiÔ¨Åcation and
the right to apply for higher education.
‚úÖ Why choose this?
Good if you want both practical experience and the option for university later.
Popular for people who want Ô¨Çexibility.
Ûæ†± Other options (if relevant):
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äì if you're very strong academically and interested in an
international environment.
10th grade (10. klasse) ‚Äì if you need one more year to decide, strengthen your grades, or explore
diÔ¨Äerent subjects.
Some personal advice:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have a multicultural background, you might later consider careers
where language, culture, or international experience matter (business, diplomacy, international
relations, education, etc.)
Denmark is quite strong in trades, technology, healthcare, and green energy ‚Äî futur e-proof areas
worth considering.
Don‚Äôt be afraid to talk to your school counselor (UU-vejleder) ‚Äî they can guide you based on your
speciÔ¨Åc grades, interests, and local options.
üëâ If you tell me a bit more about:
Your favorite school subjects
What you enjoy doing
Whether you like theoretical or practical work
If you have any dream jobs

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that's very helpful. Since you're 16, born and raised in
Denmark, Ô¨Ånished primary school, and you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you're at a great point to plan carefully.
Let me give you a simple but solid overview of your options in Denmark, and then a few personal
recommendations depending on your interests.
The Danish Education System ‚Äî Your Next Options
After primary school (folkeskole), most 16-year-olds in Denmark consider one of these:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
If you're interested in university later, or want to keep your options open:
STX (Studentereksamen) ‚Äì broad academic, includes humanities, social science, science.
HTX (Teknisk studentereksamen) ‚Äì focus on technology, natural sciences.
HHX (Handelsstudentereksamen) ‚Äì focus on business, economics, marketing.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen) ‚Äì shorter (2 years), good if you prefer a bit less theory-heavy
path.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you want to get practical skills and start working earlier, or combine work and study.
Examples: electrician, carpenter, chef, hairdresser, mechanic, healthcare worker, IT-supporter, etc.
Denmark‚Äôs vocational system is very strong and respected.
Ûæ†∞ Kombinerede forl√∏b (EUX)
A combination of vocational education + upper secondary exam.
Great if you want both practical skills and the option to go to university later.
My Recommendations for You (based on what little I know so far)
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish and Ô¨Ånished folkeskole, all doors are open for you.
Ûæ†Æ If you don‚Äôt know yet what you want:
STX or HF can be a good safe choice.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2You‚Äôll get broad education, time to Ô¨Ågure out your interests.
You‚Äôll keep doors open for university or other paths.
Ûæ†Ø If you like business, economics, or entrepreneurship:
HHX could be a strong option.
Denmark has many business opportunities ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre interested in international
business, Ô¨Ånance, or starting your own company.
Ûæ†∞ If you're more into technical or science Ô¨Åelds:

Example: skilled trades, IT-support, healthcare, etc.
A small personal thought:
Since you also have a Congolese background, you might also consider how you can one day combine
your Danish education with opportunities internationally. Languages, cultural understanding, or
international business can be very valuable.
üëâ If you want, you can tell me a bit more:
What subjects do you like best?
Do you like school (more theory) or prefer more hands-on/practical?
Do you have any career dreams yet?
Do you want to go to university later?

Thank you for sharing ‚Äî you‚Äôre in a good position, and it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre thinking carefully about your
next steps. Since you just Ô¨Ånished primary school (which in Denmark typically means folkeskole up to 9th

outline a few common paths in Denmark, and then we can narrow it down based on what you feel Ô¨Åts
you:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education / High School equivalents)
These programs prepare you for higher education later on:
STX (Almen studentereksamen) ‚Äî General upper secondary education. Good if you're interested
in academic subjects (languages, social studies, science, etc.)
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen) ‚Äî Focus on business, economics, marketing. Ideal if you think you
might like working in business or management.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen) ‚Äî Focus on science, technology, IT, and engineering.

Cyprus,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Cyprus. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thanks for sharing your background ‚Äî that helps a lot. Let‚Äôs break this down based on your situation:
You‚Äôre:
16 years old
Living in Denmark
Just Ô¨Ånished folkeskole (primary/lower secondary school)
Fluent in Danish
With Cypriot roots (which may give you some extra cultural and language advantages)
Now you‚Äôre standing at the classic Danish education crossroad after 9. klasse (or 10. klasse if you took
that).
The main options you have now in Denmark are:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These prepare you for higher education later:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad academic focus ‚Äî good if you're not 100% sure what you
want yet. You get a bit of everything (languages, science, humanities).
HHX (Handelsgymnasium): Focus on business, economics, marketing. Very good if you're
interested in Ô¨Ånance, international business, or entrepreneurship.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on science, technology, and IT. Great if you're into engineering,
programming, natural sciences.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter (2 years), more practical, and for people who
maybe struggled a bit in folkeskole or want a faster route to certain professions.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education and training, EUD/EUX)
If you want a more hands-on career path and start working sooner:
Examples: electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, chef, mechanic, IT-support, healthcare assistant, etc.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2EUX: Combines vocational training with a general upper secondary exam, so you can still go to
university later.
Ûæ†∞ International Options (since you have Cypriot/EU roots)
IB (International Baccalaureate): In Denmark there are IB schools too. Good if you want an
international career or maybe study abroad later.
EU exchange programs later on.
A few questions to help you decide:
Do you enjoy studying theoretical subjects or prefer practical learning?
Do you have any early ideas about your futur e career? (business? IT? health? trades? creative arts?)
Do you want to keep doors open for university?
Do you see yourself working more in Denmark, Cyprus, or somewhere else in Europe later?
My general recommendation (if you're unsure):
‚û° STX or HHX are great default choices because they keep many doors open.
STX: if you're more into general subjects or still undecided.
HHX: if you have an interest in business, international trade, or management.
If you tell me a bit more about your interests, I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.

‚ÄúI like math & computers‚Äù
‚ÄúI like working with people‚Äù

them with some personal comments that might help:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education - Academic)
Good if you:
Like academic subjects
Consider university later
Want to keep options open
Main options:
STX (studentereksamen): broad, general; lots of humanities, social sciences, sciences.
HHX (business-oriented): economics, marketing, international trade.
HTX (technical): technology, natural sciences, IT.
HF (shorter, 2-year program): more mature students, or those who want a faster path.
If you're unsure:
STX is the most general and keeps many doors open. If you enjoy science/tech: HTX. If you‚Äôre curious
about business: HHX.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education and Training - EUD/EGU/EUX)
Good if you:
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Prefer hands-on learning
Want to start working earlier
Like practical skills (mechanic, carpenter, electrician, chef, healthcare assistant, etc.)
Note:
You typically combine school and apprenticeship.
With EUX, you combine vocational training with a higher-level academic exam ‚Äî this can allow
university access too.
Ûæ†∞ Specialized Programs / Alternatives
International Baccalaureate (IB): if you want an international education (often in English).
Efterskole: 1-year boarding school option ‚Äî often a great personal development year if you're not
fully sure yet.
My neutral recommendation based on what you‚Äôve told me:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born and raised there, and just Ô¨Ånished primary school:
If you're quite academic: STX or HTX.
If you like business: HHX.
If you're more practical or want a trade: EUX or EUD.
If you want a little time to mature or Ô¨Ågure things out: consider Efterskole.
üëâ If you tell me a bit more ‚Äî for example:
Do you like math/science, languages, arts, business, hands-on work?
Do you imagine university one day?
Do you prefer theoretical or practical learning?
‚Äî then I can give you a much more personalized recommendation.
Would you like to give me a little more about your interests?

Djibouti,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Djibouti. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. Since you're 16, have completed primary
school (I assume you mean folkeskole), and are Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you have several good options
depending a bit on your interests, goals, and personality. Let‚Äôs break it down:
The 3 Main Educational Paths After Folkeskole in Denmark:
1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
If you're interested in general academic education and perhaps aiming for university later, you can
consider:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad, academic, with focus on humanities, science, and
social studies.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination Programme): Focus on business, economics,
international trade, and languages.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination Programme): Focus on technology, science, and
innovation.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination Programme): A bit shorter (2 years), often a good Ô¨Åt if
you want a more practical or Ô¨Çexible approach to university eligibility.
2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD/EUX)
If you're more practically oriented and would like to enter the job market earlier or get hands-on
training:
Trades (plumber, electrician, carpenter, etc.)
Health care assistant
OÔ¨Éce work, retail, etc.
With EUX you can combine vocational training with academic studies, giving you both a trade
qualiÔ¨Åcation and eligibility for higher education.
3. 10th Grade (if you're unsure and want more time to decide)
Some students take 10th grade to mature academically or personally before choosing the next
step.
You can do 10th grade at a regular school, efterskole, or special 10th grade programs.
A Few Personal Considerations
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Do you enjoy studying?
If yes ‚Üí  consider STX, HHX, HTX, HF.
If not so much ‚Üí  consider vocational training (EUD/EUX) or 10th grade Ô¨Årst.
Do you have career dreams already?

Do you want to work internationally one day?

Do you want to work sooner?
Vocational training may get you into work faster.
My honest recommendation (based on your age and situation):
Since you just Ô¨Ånished primary school and are Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you‚Äôre in a strong position. Unless you
have a clear idea for vocational training, I would recommend:
‚û° Go for one of the gymnasiale uddannelser (STX, HHX, HTX or HF)
This keeps many doors open for you. You can always switch direction later.

Dominica,"Uddannelsesmuligheder efter folkeskole

I just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Excellent ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down thoughtfully.
You're 16, Danish-born with Dominican roots, Ô¨Çuent in Danish, just Ô¨Ånished primary school (which in
Denmark likely means folkeskole or similar). Now you stand right at the typical point where Danish
students choose between several educational paths. Your options depend a bit on your interests, but
here‚Äôs a clear overview of your possibilities:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
This is the most common route if you're interested in continuing general education and possibly going
to university later. There are several types:
STX (Almen studentereksamen) ‚Äî General upper secondary. Broadest option, strong for
humanities, sciences, and social sciences.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen) ‚Äî Business-oriented. Good if you're interested in business,
economics, marketing, international trade, etc.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen) ‚Äî Focused on technology, science, IT, and engineering.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen) ‚Äî A shorter 2-year option, good for some who want a slightly
more practical and Ô¨Çexible route to higher education.
üí° When to choose one of these?
If you like academic subjects.
If you might want to go to university.
If you‚Äôre still exploring and want to keep doors open.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET)
This is more hands-on, preparing you directly for a profession.
EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse): Covers many Ô¨Åelds like carpentry, electrician, hairdresser, cook,
mechanic, health care assistant, etc.
EUX: A hybrid where you get both vocational training and a general upper secondary diploma,
allowing you to work or go to university.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2üí° When to choose this?
If you like practical, hands-on work.
If you want to enter the workforce sooner.
If you want both vocational skills and the option for higher education.
Ûæ†∞ Other possibilities
10th grade (10. klasse) ‚Äî Some take an extra year before upper secondary. Useful if you want
more time to Ô¨Ågure things out, improve grades, or mature academically.
International programs ‚Äî Like IB (International Baccalaureate) if you're strong in English and
want an international diploma.
Private programs / specialized schools ‚Äî E.g. creative schools (design, music, etc.).
My recommendation (based on your info):
Since you're bilingual, multicultural, and Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you have an advantage in:
International business
Social sciences
Languages
Technology (if you‚Äôre interested)
If you‚Äôre unsure:
STX or HHX is often a safe, broad choice that keeps many doors open. If you enjoy business or
international aÔ¨Äairs, HHX might Ô¨Åt you especially well. If you enjoy science or tech, HTX could be great.
If you prefer practical learning:
EUX is a very smart option ‚Äî you get a profession and a diploma for further studies.

Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)

STX (Almen studentereksamen):

‚úÖ Good if you're not sure yet what you want to study.

Thank you for sharing ‚Äî you're actually in a very good position with multiple opportunities ahead. Since

Danish students choose between several diÔ¨Äerent educational paths. Let‚Äôs go through some realistic
options based on your situation:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These are the most common next steps if you're thinking of university later on. A few options:
STX (Almen Studentereksamen)
General upper secondary education. Broad academic subjects like languages, sciences, social studies,
etc.
‚Üí Good if you're not 100% sure yet and want to keep many doors open.
HHX (Handelsskolens Studentereksamen)
Focus on business, economics, languages, and international topics.
‚Üí Good if you‚Äôre interested in international business, trade, or economics.
HTX (Teknisk Studentereksamen)
Focus on technology, science, IT, and engineering.
‚Üí Good if you're interested in science, technology or engineering Ô¨Åelds.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
Shorter (2 years), more practical and targeted.
‚Üí Good if you prefer a more applied education and want faster access to professional education
afterwards.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you're more hands-on and want to enter the job market faster:
Programs such as electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, IT-supporter, healthcare assistant, chef, etc.
You usually combine school with apprenticeship (praktikplads).
Can lead to solid careers or further education (for example via EUX).
Ûæ†∞ EUX (Combined Vocational + Academic)
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Combines vocational training with an academic exam.
Allows you to both learn a trade and qualify for higher education.
Example: You become a skilled electrician, but can also later study engineering if you want.
Ûæ†± International opportunities
Given your Ecuadorian background, you could also:
Study languages further (Spanish, international business, diplomacy).
Consider exchange programs or international studies.
Explore opportunities where you combine Danish, Spanish and English ‚Äî you're trilingual, which is
a major advantage in today's world.
My personal recommendation (based on your age, background and being open):
If you are unsure: STX is a safe bet, keeps all doors open.
If you like business and languages: HHX could Ô¨Åt very well.
If you enjoy practical work and want job experience soon: EUD or EUX could be excellent.
If you are more technical/scientiÔ¨Åc: HTX might be perfect.
üëâ Question for you, to help me reÔ¨Åne my recommendation even more:
Do you already have some interests (business, technology, health, languages, etc)?
Do you prefer more academic or practical learning?
Do you dream of studying at university one day or starting a career earlier?

HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
Shorter (2 years), more practical and targeted.
‚Üí Good if you prefer a more applied education and want faster access to professional education
afterwards.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you're more hands-on and want to enter the job market faster:
Programs such as electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, IT-supporter, healthcare assistant, chef, etc.
You usually combine school with apprenticeship (praktikplads).
Can lead to solid careers or further education (for example via EUX).
Ûæ†∞ EUX (Combined Vocational + Academic)
Combines vocational training with an academic exam.
Allows you to both learn a trade and qualify for higher education.
Example: You become a skilled electrician, but can also later study engineering if you want.
Ûæ†± International opportunities
Given your Ecuadorian background, you could also:
Study languages further (Spanish, international business, diplomacy).
Consider exchange programs or international studies.
Explore opportunities where you combine Danish, Spanish and English ‚Äî you're trilingual, which is
a major advantage in today's world.
My personal recommendation (based on your age, background and being open):
If you are unsure: STX is a safe bet, keeps all doors open.
If you like business and languages: HHX could Ô¨Åt very well.
If you enjoy practical work and want job experience soon: EUD or EUX could be excellent.
If you are more technical/scientiÔ¨Åc: HTX might be perfect.
üëâ Question for you, to help me reÔ¨Åne my recommendation even more:
Do you already have some interests (business, technology, health, languages, etc)?
Do you prefer more academic or practical learning?
Do you dream of studying at university one day or starting a career earlier?
If you answer these, I can give you a very speciÔ¨Åc plan. Shall we? üòä

choices that Ô¨Åt both your interests and opportunities in Denmark.
Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school (folkeskolen), your next educational steps in Denmark typically
fall into these main paths:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper secondary education / high school level)
These are generally for students who may want to continue into university later:
STX (Alment gymnasium): Broad academic education with focus on languages, sciences, and
humanities. Good if you're unsure exactly what you want to study later.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium): Focus on business, economics, marketing, and international trade.
Great if you're interested in business or management.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technical subjects, IT, science, technology and engineering.
Good if you're interested in engineering, science, IT.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter and more practical, often for people who want
to work sooner or do certain vocational or professional programs.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education and training - VET)
If you're more interested in learning a trade, becoming an apprentice, or starting work sooner, you
can take a vocational track.
Denmark has strong VET programs for electricians, mechanics, carpenters, healthcare workers, IT-
supporters, etc.
Ûæ†∞ EUX (Combined vocational + academic program)
Gives you both a vocational qualiÔ¨Åcation and a high school diploma.
A very good option if you want to keep doors open: you can both work and continue to university.
A few personal considerations for you:
Since you‚Äôre bilingual (Danish + likely Arabic), this gives you a fantastic advantage in international
careers, business, diplomacy, or companies that operate across Europe and the Middle East.

Denmark and you're now considering your next step, let‚Äôs look at your options and what might suit you,
given your background, age, and situation.
The Danish Educational System after Primary School
In Denmark, after folkeskole (primary school), most students choose between a few main paths:
1. Gymnasium (General Upper Secondary Education - STX, HHX, HTX, or HF)
2. Vocational Education and Training (EUD/EUX)
3. International or specialized programs
Let's break them down for you:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
STX (Almen studentereksamen):
General academic program, prepares you well for university. Good if you're not yet sure what you
want to do but want to keep many doors open.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination):
Focuses on business, economics, languages, and marketing. Great if you're interested in business
or international trade ‚Äî perhaps interesting since you have an international background.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination):
Focuses on science, technology, and engineering. Good if you're into IT, natural sciences, or
technical subjects.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination):
Shorter (2 years), slightly more Ô¨Çexible, often for students who prefer a more practical or
alternative learning environment.
Ûæ†Ø Vocational Education and Training (EUD / EUX)
EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse):
Prepares you for a speciÔ¨Åc trade or profession, e.g., electrician, carpenter, chef, healthcare worker,
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2etc. You start working sooner and get practical skills.
EUX:
Combines vocational education with a more academic part, so you can both work in a trade and
have the option to go to university later.
Ûæ†∞ Other Options
International High School (IB):
If you're very strong in English and like international studies, an International Baccalaureate (IB)
can be a very strong option, especially if you might consider studying or working abroad in the
future.
Preparatory courses (10th grade, efterskole, etc.):
If you want a bit more time to decide or to mature academically or socially, 10th grade or an
efterskole can be a great ""bridge year.""
My personal recommendation for you:
Since you're 16, Ô¨Çuent in Danish, and have just Ô¨Ånished primary school:
If you are academically motivated and want to keep as many doors open as possible:
üëâ STX or HHX
(STX if you're more into general subjects; HHX if you're curious about business and international
economics)
If you're more practically oriented or want to start working sooner:
üëâ EUX
(since it combines the best of both worlds: practical training + academic options)
If you're still unsure and want some time to explore and grow:
üëâ Efterskole (10th grade)
(a lot of people in Denmark Ô¨Ånd this very valuable ‚Äî it can be life-changing in terms of personal
development and friendships)
Also important to consider:
Your interests (do you like science, languages, business, arts, technology‚Ä¶?)
Your strengths (are you better at theoretical or practical learning?)
Your long-term goals (university? work? entrepreneurship?)

your main options in Denmark‚Äôs education system, and then I‚Äôll give you a few tailored suggestions:
Your Main Options Right Now
1. Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
Academic upper secondary education.
Typically 3 years (HF is 2 years).
Prepares you for university.
STX: general academic subjects.
HHX: business/economy-oriented.
HTX: technical/science-oriented.
HF: shorter, often more practical, some people take it later.
2. Vocational education (EUD / EUX)
More hands-on.
Prepares you for a skilled trade or job directly.
EUX allows you to combine vocational training with academic studies, giving you access to
university later if you want.
3. Other paths (International schools, folk high schools, etc.)
Some choose to take a gap year or explore special schools.
Eg. language schools, production schools (produktionsskole), or preparatory courses.
My Recommendations for You
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish, have Ô¨Ånished primary school here, and likely know both your Danish and
Eritrean background well, you‚Äôre in a strong position. Here are a few scenarios depending on your
interests:
If you want to keep all doors open:
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2STX (Alment Gymnasium)
Great if you're not sure yet.
Gives you broad general education.
You can later choose university studies in nearly any Ô¨Åeld.
If you‚Äôre interested in business or international trade:
HHX (Handelsgymnasium)
Strong if you like economy, business, marketing, languages.
Also useful if you want to build connections for both Denmark and Eritrea (or internationally).
If you're into science, technology, or engineering:
HTX (Teknisk Gymnasium)
Focus on STEM subjects.
Good for later studies in engineering, IT, health sciences, etc.
If you like learning by doing and want to work sooner:
EUX (Vocational + Academic)
You get a skilled trade (IT, healthcare, electrician, etc.) and a gymnasium-level degree.
You can work after graduation or go to university later.
A few personal notes:
As someone with an Eritrean background, speaking multiple languages or understanding multiple
cultures can become a huge advantage ‚Äî whether in business, international relations, or
healthcare.
Think about what subjects you enjoy most: math? biology? languages? social studies? This can
guide your choice.

later.

Thank you for sharing ‚Äî you're in a really good position right now because you have several great

what to do after folkeskolen (9th or 10th grade). Let‚Äôs walk through some possible paths depending a bit
on your interests, strengths, and goals:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
If you enjoy academic subjects and might want to go to university one day, this is a strong choice.
Main options:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad, academic, good if you're not 100% sure yet what you
want to study later.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium): Focus on business, economics, and international trade.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on science, technology, IT, and engineering.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): 2-year program if you want a bit more practical approach but
still want access to higher education.
‚úÖ Good if:
You like schoolwork, enjoy learning new things.
You want to keep university as an option.
You want a solid foundation for many careers.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education / EUD)
If you're more hands-on and want to work sooner, vocational education can be great.

Ô¨Çuent in danish.

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. You're in an exciting phase right now,
where the choices you make can open up many doors. Since you're 16, just Ô¨Ånished primary school
(which I assume means folkeskole), let‚Äôs look at your most common options in Denmark and tailor it to
your background:
The typical educational paths after folkeskole:
1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These prepare you for higher education. They usually last 3 years.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad academic focus (sciences, social sciences, humanities).
Good if you're unsure but want options for university.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium): Focus on business, economics, and international trade.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technology, science, and innovation.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): Shorter (2 years), a bit more practical, often used by those
who prefer a bit less theoretical education.
2. Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education and Training - VET)
If you're more interested in learning a trade, hands-on work, or getting into the job market sooner,
this is very respected in Denmark. It combines school and apprenticeship.
Some personal considerations based on what you shared:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have the advantage of being bilingual (perhaps you also speak
Amharic or another Ethiopian language), that‚Äôs a great asset both in Denmark and internationally.
If you're interested in university later on, then STX, HHX, or HTX are your strongest paths.
If you're interested in practical work or entrepreneurship earlier, then VET might be a strong
option.
Denmark highly values international competencies, and your background could be a strength if
you‚Äôre interested in Ô¨Åelds like international business, diplomacy, development work, medicine,
technology, or social work.

My recommendation:
If you‚Äôre not yet sure what you want long-term (which is completely normal at 16), STX is often the safest

HF: A bit shorter (2 years), more practical, and often used as a second chance pathway or for
people who want to go directly into certain professions or higher education quickly.
2. Vocational Education (EUD / EUX)
You combine practical training with school. Good if you want to become a skilled worker

EUX allows you to get both a vocational education and a general upper secondary diploma at

3. International options
You might consider International Baccalaureate (IB) if you're good at English and want

background if you might want to study abroad one day.
4. Take a sabbatical or 10th grade (efterskole, 10. klasse, h√∏jskole)
Many Danes take a year in 10th grade or efterskole to mature, travel, or explore interests
before committing to upper secondary school.

Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre 16, born and raised in Denmark, just Ô¨Ånished primary school, Ô¨Çuent in Danish, and have
French roots. That gives you quite a few options. Let‚Äôs go step by step based on the Danish system and

First, small clariÔ¨Åcation:
In Denmark, ""primary school"" often means Folkeskole, which usually runs until 9th or 10th grade. Since
you're 16 and Ô¨Ånished primary school, I assume you've just Ô¨Ånished 9th or 10th grade.

What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about your background ‚Äî that helps a lot. You're in a really good position,
and it's great that you're already thinking ahead. Since you just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark (I
assume you mean folkeskole), your next steps would typically be one of several options depending on
your interests, strengths, and long-term goals.
Let‚Äôs look at your main options in Denmark after folkeskole:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
This is the most common next step if you're aiming for university later.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): The most general high school education. Good if you're unsur e
what you want or want to keep doors open for university studies later (hum anities, science, social
sciences, etc).
HHX (Handelsskole): Focuses more on business, economics, and international trade. Might be
interesting if you have an interest in business, economics or want to work internationally
(especially with your multicultural background).
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focuses on technical subjects, science, technology, IT, and
engineering.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A shorter, 2-year program for more practical-oriented
students, often a bit easier if you want a faster path to higher education or certain professions.
üëâ Recommendation:
If you‚Äôre academically strong and want to keep as many doors open as possible, STX is a great choice. If
you lean towards business or technology, HHX or HTX may Ô¨Åt better.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (EUD - Vocational Education and Training)
If you prefer a more practical, hands-on education leading directly to a profession (e.g. electrician,
carpenter, chef, healthcare assistant, etc.).
You‚Äôll combine school with apprenticeships.
Many EUD programs now also allow you to continue studying later if you change your mind.
There‚Äôs also EUX, which combines vocational training with gymnasium-level studies so you can
both get a profession and qualify for university later.

If you enjoy working with your hands or a speciÔ¨Åc profession already interests you, this is a strong, job-
secure path. EUX is excellent if you want both practical skills and the option for higher education later.
Ûæ†∞ 10th Grade (10. klasse)
Some students take an extra year after folkeskole to mature, Ô¨Ågure out their interests, or improve grades
before entering gymnasium or EUD.
üëâ Recommendation:
If you're uncertain or want a year to grow, this can be very useful. Many people also enjoy attending an
efterskole in 10th grade ‚Äî it's a very Danish experience, great for personal development, making friends,
and gaining independence.
Personal factors to consider:
Are you more academic or more practical?
Do you know what you enjoy (science, business, technology, art, people, etc)?
Do you want to go to university one day, or get a profession sooner?
üëâ Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have a multicultural background, you also have an advantage if
you're interested in international work, languages, or diplomacy in the futur e. That could make HHX,
STX, or even international programs interesting too.

You're Ô¨Çuent in Danish.
You have a German family background (which might open some extra doors).
In Denmark, after Folkeskole, most students choose between a few main paths:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
The most common path if you want to keep your options open for university later.
STX (Almen gymnasium)
Broadest education (languages, science, humanities).
Good if you are not yet sure what you want to do.
Keeps all university doors open.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium)
Focus on business, economics, marketing.
Great if you're interested in commerce, Ô¨Ånance, or management.

More practical/theoretical mix.
Often used if you want a quicker path to certain professions or adult education.

EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse)

EUX
Mixes vocational training with academic classes.
Gives you both a trade and a university entrance qualiÔ¨Åcation.
Ûæ†∞ International Options
Since you have German roots, you could consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî oÔ¨Äered in Denmark and recognized worldwide.
German schools in Denmark or even studying part-time in Germany.
This could give you a more international proÔ¨Åle if you see yourself studying or working abroad
later.
My suggestion:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have a German background, you should think about:
What are your interests? (science, business, IT, languages, practical skills‚Ä¶?)
Do you want a university degree later, or start working earlier?
If you want to keep doors open:
STX or IB is usually the safest and broadest choice.
If you like business:
HHX is very strong in Denmark, especially if you might want to work internationally later.
If you're tech/science-oriented:
HTX could be great.
If you're practical/hands-on:

Keeps all university doors open.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium)
Focus on business, economics, marketing.
Great if you're interested in commerce, Ô¨Ånance, or management.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium)
Focus on technology, science, IT, engineering.
Good if you're into natural sciences, technology, or IT.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
Shorter (2 years).
More practical/theoretical mix.
Often used if you want a quicker path to certain professions or adult education.
Ûæ†Ø Vocational Education (EUD / EUX)
If you prefer a more hands-on approach, want to start working earlier, or train for a speciÔ¨Åc trade:
EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse)
Trains you directly for jobs (crafts, industry, healthcare, etc.)
EUX
Mixes vocational training with academic classes.
Gives you both a trade and a university entrance qualiÔ¨Åcation.
Ûæ†∞ International Options
Since you have German roots, you could consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî oÔ¨Äered in Denmark and recognized worldwide.
German schools in Denmark or even studying part-time in Germany.
This could give you a more international proÔ¨Åle if you see yourself studying or working abroad
later.
My suggestion:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and have a German background, you should think about:
What are your interests? (science, business, IT, languages, practical skills‚Ä¶?)
Do you want a university degree later, or start working earlier?
If you want to keep doors open:
STX or IB is usually the safest and broadest choice.
If you like business:
HHX is very strong in Denmark, especially if you might want to work internationally later.
If you're tech/science-oriented:
HTX could be great.
If you're practical/hands-on:
EUD/EUX are very respected and lead to good jobs.
üëâ If you tell me a bit more about your interests, hobbies, and what you enjoy studying, I can give a
more tailored recommendation.

What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that's very helpful context. Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished
primary school (which in Denmark is Folkeskole, usually ending after 9th or 10th grade), you‚Äôre at a
typical decision point. In Denmark, there are several good paths you can consider depending on your
interests, strengths, and future ambitions.
Let me walk you through the main options, and I‚Äôll also give a little personal recommendation at the
end:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
This is a natural path if you're considering higher education later (university, university college, etc.).
STX (Alment Gymnasium)
Broad academic education. Great if you like languages, humanities, sciences, or social sciences.
HHX (Handelsgymnasium)
Focus on business, economics, marketing, and international trade.
HTX (Teknisk Gymnasium)
Focus on technical subjects like IT, technology, natural sciences, and engineering.

A bit shorter (2 years), more practice-oriented, often used if you want to continue but don‚Äôt want
the full 3-year gymnasium.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
More hands-on, learning a trade or profession.
For example: electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, healthcare assistant, mechanic, chef, etc.
Often includes both school and apprenticeship (praktikplads).
Ûæ†∞ Kombinerede uddannelser (EUX)
A combination of vocational training and gymnasium-level education.
Allows you to both learn a trade and get qualiÔ¨Åcations for higher education.
Good if you want Ô¨Çexibility.

10th grade (10. klasse) ‚Äî if you feel you need an extra year to prepare.
Efterskole ‚Äî a special one-year boarding school, often combining school with personal

My recommendation (since you asked)
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born and raised in Denmark, but with roots from Ghana, you have a strong
multicultural background that could be an advantage in many areas.
If you‚Äôre academically interested and unsure exactly what you want yet:
üëâ STX or HHX could be a good choice ‚Äî they keep many doors open.
If you like practical work but still want an education that allows you to move on to university
later:
üëâ EUX is a very smart option.
If you want a bit of a break while still learning and growing personally:
üëâ Consider 10th grade or an efterskole.
üëâ Important tip: In Denmark, there‚Äôs no one ‚Äúbest‚Äù path ‚Äî many people change later. What‚Äôs most
important is Ô¨Ånding a path that matches your interests and strengths right now.

Thanks for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school in
Denmark (which typically means 9th or 10th grade depending on your situation), you‚Äôre now facing one
of the important choices most Danish teens make. Let me lay out a few common options and some
thoughts, tailored to your situation:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF) ‚Äî Academic Upper Secondary Education
STX (Alment gymnasium): Good if you like a broad academic education (hum anities, science,
social studies). It keeps most doors open for university later.
HHX (Handelsskole): Focuses more on business, economics, languages. A good Ô¨Åt if you're
interested in trade, economics or international business (especially with your Greek background).
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): More technical and science-oriented. Great if you‚Äôre interested in
technology, natural sciences, or engineering.
HF (2-year program): More practical, shorter, good if you want a quicker path to certain
professional educations.
My thoughts:
Gymnasium is a solid choice if you are not yet 100% sure what you want to do later. Since you're Ô¨Çuent in
Danish and have an international background, both STX and HHX could be very strong choices
depending on your interests.
Ûæ†Ø EUD / EUX ‚Äî Vocational Education
Focuses on preparing you for a trade (carpenter, electrician, hairdresser, chef, etc.).
EUX combines vocational training with academic courses, allowing you to keep university options
open.
My thoughts:
If you have a clear passion for a speciÔ¨Åc trade or profession, this can be a great way to get into the job
market sooner. EUX is also a very Ô¨Çexible path that combines the best of both worlds.
Ûæ†∞ IB (International Baccalaureate)

Good Ô¨Åt if you think you might want to study or work internationally.
My thoughts:
Since you have a multicultural background, the IB could also be a very strong option, especially if you

Ûæ†± Take a ‚Äú10th grade year‚Äù (Efterskole or regular 10th grade)
Many choose to take 10th grade to mature, explore interests, and prepare better for gymnasium.
Efterskole is popular for the experience, social development, and sometimes specialization
(sports, arts, languages, etc.)
My thoughts:
If you're unsure and want a year to grow personally while still learning, an efterskole year could be a
fantastic life experience.
To sum up:
Path Good for you if:
STX You want general academic preparation
HHX You‚Äôre interested in business, languages, or economics

Since you just Ô¨Ånished primary school (in Denmark that‚Äôs Folkeskolen), your next steps typically are:
Ûæ†Æ Choose a youth education (""ungdomsuddannelse"")
In Denmark, after 9th or 10th grade, most students choose between:
Path Description Who it's good for
STX (Gymnasium)Focus on academic, general education (math,
languages, science, etc.). 3 years.If you want to keep many doors
open: university, professions, etc.
HHXBusiness-oriented gymnasium: economics,
business, marketing, languages. 3 years.If you're interested in business,
trade, management.
HTXTechnical/scientiÔ¨Åc gymnasium: technology, IT,
engineering. 3 years.If you're into science, technology,
engineering, or IT.
EUXCombination of vocational education and
gymnasium.If you want both practical skills and
academic qualiÔ¨Åcations.
EUDPure vocational education (learning a trade:
carpenter, mechanic, chef, etc.).If you want a more practical hands-
on career early.
IB (International
Baccalaureate)International program in English. 2 years (after
1 year prep).If you're aiming internationally, or
prefer learning in English.
Ûæ†Ø How to choose?
Ask yourself a few questions:
Do I enjoy academic studies (reading, writing, exams)?
Am I more practical and enjoy working with my hands or creating things?
Do I already have a sense of a future career? (doctor, engineer, teacher, business owner, etc.)
Would I like to study abroad one day?
Ûæ†∞ A few possible examples based on your background:
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2STX: great if you're unsure yet; keeps most options open. Denmark has great higher education
options later.
HHX: could Ô¨Åt well if you're interested in business, economics, or perhaps one day want to start
something internationally (your Guinea-Bissau background could be very valuable in international
business or diplomacy).
HTX: perfect if you like technology, IT, engineering or science ‚Äî sectors where Denmark has high
demand.
IB: could be smart if you're thinking of studying abroad later on, or if you feel comfortable studying
in English.
Ûæ†± My honest recommendation:
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, and just Ô¨Ånishing Folkeskolen, I'd recommend STX or HHX ‚Äî unless you
already know you want something technical or vocational. Both keep many doors open. If you're still
unsure, STX is probably the safest and most Ô¨Çexible choice.
üëâ Important tip:
Most youth education programs oÔ¨Äer ‚Äúbrobygning‚Äù (intro programs). You can often try out diÔ¨Äerent
paths before fully committing ‚Äî I highly recommend you do that if possible.

Guinea,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Guinea. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing ‚Äî and Ô¨Årst of all, congratulations on Ô¨Ånishing primary school! That‚Äôs a big step.
Since you're 16, you‚Äôre likely looking at what‚Äôs called ungdomsuddannelse (youth education) in Denmark,
which typically comes after primary school (folkeskole). You have several main paths to consider,
depending on your interests, strengths, and what kind of career or further education you might want
later.
Let me break it down simply:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education - Academic)
If you enjoy school subjects, want a broad education, and are maybe considering university later:
STX (Studentereksamen): General upper secondary. Very broad ‚Äî lots of subjects: languages,
science, social studies, etc.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination Programme): Focuses on business, economics,
languages.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination Programme): Focuses on technology, science, IT.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination Programme): A bit shorter, often used if you want
university but in a slightly more practical setting.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET / EUD)
If you're more hands-on, like practical work, or want to enter the job market faster:
Many programs: e.g. electrician, carpenter, mechanic, chef, hairdresser, health care worker, IT
support, etc.
You often combine school with real work experience (apprenticeships).
Ûæ†∞ Kombinerede forl√∏b (Combination Programs)
If you're unsure or want a bit of both academic and practical education:
EUX: Combines vocational training with upper secondary school, so you can both work and qualify
for higher education.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Ûæ†± Other options (Special Programs / International Pathways)
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish but have an international background:
Some international schools oÔ¨Äer IB (International Baccalaureate), if you want more global options.
Preparatory courses or language-based programs if you want to strengthen speciÔ¨Åc subjects
before choosing.
A few personal questions you might consider:
Do you like theoretical schoolwork (math, languages, science)?
Do you enjoy practical, hands-on tasks?
Do you want to work soon, or study longer?
Do you have any dream jobs or interests (business, health, IT, design, etc)?
üëâ If you tell me a little more about your interests, I can help recommend a much more speciÔ¨Åc
path for you.
For example:
If you say: ""I like computers and tech"" ‚Äî> HTX or EUX-IT.
If you say: ""I want to help people"" ‚Äî> HF or social/healthcare VET.
If you say: ""I like business"" ‚Äî> HHX.

In Denmark, you typically have a few main paths after primary school:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Academic Programmes)

Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training, VET / EUD)
You learn a trade and get practical experience while studying. This can lead directly to jobs or further
studies.
Examples: electrician, carpenter, mechanic, chef, hairdresser, social and health care, etc.
These can also be a good route if you prefer hands-on learning and want to enter the workforce

goals.
Let me lay out the main options, and then I‚Äôll give a few personal recommendations based on your
background:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
This is the academic route that prepares you for university later.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad focus ‚Äî good if you're still unsure and want to keep
doors open. Covers Danish, English, science, social sciences, etc.
HHX (Handelsskole): Focus on business, economics, and international trade ‚Äî useful if you‚Äôre
interested in business, Ô¨Ånance, marketing, or international work.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technology, science, and IT ‚Äî great if you like science, tech,

HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter (2 years), more practical, and good if you want
Ô¨Çexibility and perhaps aren‚Äôt ready for 3 years of gymnasium.
Ûæ†Ø EUD or EUX (Erhvervsuddannelse / Erhvervsuddannelse + gymnasial eksamen)
This is a vocational education path where you learn a trade and often combine school with
apprenticeships.
EUD: If you already have an idea for a trade (electrician, carpenter, chef, hairdresser, etc.)
EUX: A combination of vocational and academic education ‚Äî gives you both a trade and access to
higher education later.
Ûæ†∞ 10th grade (10. klasse)
If you're not quite sure yet, or want to strengthen your grades or skills before starting your next step,
many students take 10th grade, either at a regular school, efterskole, or another institution.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2A few personal suggestions for you:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born here, but with roots in Haiti, you actually have some advantages:
You may have a natural interest or strength in languages, culture, international relations, or
business, because of your multicultural background.
If you enjoy academics and want to keep doors open, STX or HHX might be very good choices.
If you enjoy practical learning or already know you like working with your hands or in a speciÔ¨Åc
trade, EUX could be a very smart choice ‚Äî you get both practical skills and the option to go to

10th grade at an efterskole can also give you time to grow, meet new people, and explore your
interests.

üëâ If you're business or internationally minded: HHX
üëâ If you're tech/science-oriented: HTX

If you're more academically oriented, these could be a strong option:
STX (Almen studentereksamen)
Good if you like a broad range of subjects (Danish, languages, history, sciences).
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen)
Focus on business, economics, and languages. Might be good if you're interested in international
business ‚Äî especially considering your bilingual background.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen)
Focus on technical and natural sciences (IT, technology, engineering, biology, etc.).
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen)
Shorter (2 years), more practice-oriented, for students who might want to move faster towards a
profession or further education.
‚úÖ Best if you:
Want to keep university options open
Are academically motivated
Enjoy studying diÔ¨Äerent subjects
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you're more hands-on and want to get into the job market earlier:

‚úÖ Best if you:

Want to work and earn money earlier
Ûæ†∞ Combination programs (EUX)

‚úÖ Best if you:

A few personal thoughts based on what you've told me:
Your bilingual / multicultural background might be very valuable if you pursue something with
languages, international business, or global relations.
HHX or STX could open a lot of doors if you‚Äôre still unsur e exactly what you want.
If you're more hands-on or already know you like working with tech, healthcare, or a speciÔ¨Åc craft,
EUD or EUX could be great.

HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen)
Shorter (2 years), more practice-oriented, for students who might want to move faster towards a
profession or further education.
‚úÖ Best if you:
Want to keep university options open
Are academically motivated
Enjoy studying diÔ¨Äerent subjects
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you're more hands-on and want to get into the job market earlier:
You combine school and apprenticeship
Wide range of areas: business, health, technology, crafts, IT, etc.
Many of these lead directly to good jobs.
‚úÖ Best if you:
Prefer practical learning
Already have a sense of a profession you want to pursue
Want to work and earn money earlier
Ûæ†∞ Combination programs (EUX)
A mix of vocational training + academic education
Allows you to learn a trade but still qualify for university later
‚úÖ Best if you:
Want both practical skills and academic possibilities later
A few personal thoughts based on what you've told me:
Your bilingual / multicultural background might be very valuable if you pursue something with
languages, international business, or global relations.
HHX or STX could open a lot of doors if you‚Äôre still unsur e exactly what you want.
If you're more hands-on or already know you like working with tech, healthcare, or a speciÔ¨Åc craft,
EUD or EUX could be great.
üëâ My quick recommendation (if you're unsure):
STX or HHX ‚Äî they keep the most doors open while you explore your interests further.
If you tell me a bit more:
What subjects do you enjoy?
Do you like schoolwork, or do you prefer more practical work?
Any career dreams yet?
‚Äî then I can give you a much more tailored suggestion. Shall we? üòä

Hungary,"Uddannelsesvalg i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Hungary. 
I just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about your background ‚Äî that helps a lot. Since you're 16, just Ô¨Ånished
primary school, and are Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you‚Äôre at a typical point for choosing your upper secondary
education in Denmark. Let me walk you through some realistic options and recommendations based on
your situation:
Ûæ†Æ General Upper Secondary Education (Gymnasiale Uddannelser)
If you‚Äôre academically interested and may want to attend university later:
STX (Almen Studentereksamen)
Focus: Broad academic education (languages, science, humanities, social sciences).
Good if: You're not yet sure what you want to study, or want to keep doors open for many types of
higher education.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination Programme)
Focus: Business, economics, international trade, marketing.
Good if: You're interested in business, Ô¨Ånance, or international relations (especially valuable with
your Hungarian background).
HTX (Higher Technical Examination Programme)
Focus: Technology, IT, science, engineering.
Good if: You enjoy science, technology, or engineering-related subjects.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination)
Focus: A bit shorter (2 years), often more practical or for those who want to enter professional
training or higher education but prefer a more Ô¨Çexible system.
Good if: You prefer a more practical or less theoretical approach.
Ûæ†Ø Vocational Education and Training (Erhvervsuddannelse, EUD)
If you‚Äôre more interested in getting practical skills and entering the job market earlier (or through
apprenticeships):
Fields include: electrician, IT support, carpentry, social care, healthcare, chef, and many more.
You can still continue to higher education later via eux (a combined vocational and academic
programme).
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Ûæ†∞ Special International Angle
Since you have a Hungarian background, you could also consider:
Studying Danish-Hungarian relations, language, or international business in the future.
You could, for example, later leverage your bilingual ability.
Exchange years or international schools (if you're considering becoming very internationally
oriented).
My personal recommendation:
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, have an international background, and are still young:
STX or HHX might be your strongest options if you want to keep a broad range of opportunities
open.
If you have strong interest in tech or engineering: HTX.
If you prefer a quicker, more practical route: EUD with EUX option.
If you tell me a bit more (e.g. your interests, whether you like math, languages, business, tech, or hands-

next step should be. I'm Ô¨Çuent in danish.

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps me give you a much more thoughtful answer.
Since you're 16, have Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark, and are now considering your next step, your
situation is pretty common for Danish students at this stage. In Denmark, after folkeskole (primary
school), most students choose between a few main educational paths depending on their interests,
talents, and future career goals. Let me lay out your main options, and then I‚Äôll give you some advice:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
If you're academically inclined and think you might want to go to university later:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): The most common upper secondary school. Broad subjects ‚Äî
humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences.
HTX (Teknisk studentereksamen): Focus on technical and scientiÔ¨Åc subjects (good if you're
interested in technology, engineering, natural sciences).
HHX (Handelsstudentereksamen): Focus on business, economics, and marketing.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): Shorter 2-year version, a bit more practical and Ô¨Çexible,
often for those who prefer a slightly diÔ¨Äerent academic pace.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you're more practically oriented or want to start working sooner:
You combine school with internships or apprenticeships.
Fields include carpentry, electrician, IT-support, healthcare, gastronomy, mechanics, and many
others.
Many vocational programs now have good career prospects and decent salaries ‚Äî especially in
areas where Denmark needs skilled workers.
Ûæ†∞ Kombinationsforl√∏b (Kombineret ungdomsuddannelse)
There are also hybrid programs if you‚Äôre not 100% sure whether you want an academic or vocational
path. For example:
EUX (combines vocational training with a general upper secondary education).

International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî taught in English, can be an advantage if you consider studying

My Recommendation (based on your brief info)
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born in Denmark, and just Ô¨Ånished folkeskole, you have all doors open.
Here are a few personal factors you might consider:
If you enjoy studying, reading, and would like to leave open the possibility of university: STX or
HTX.
If you're curious about business, Ô¨Ånance, or marketing: HHX.
If you want a faster way into work, and like hands-on learning: EUD or EUX.

Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps me give you a much more thoughtful answer.
Since you're 16, have Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark, and are now considering your next step, your
situation is pretty common for Danish students at this stage. In Denmark, after folkeskole (primary
school), most students choose between a few main educational paths depending on their interests,
talents, and future career goals. Let me lay out your main options, and then I‚Äôll give you some advice:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
If you're academically inclined and think you might want to go to university later:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): The most common upper secondary school. Broad subjects ‚Äî
humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences.
HTX (Teknisk studentereksamen): Focus on technical and scientiÔ¨Åc subjects (good if you're
interested in technology, engineering, natural sciences).
HHX (Handelsstudentereksamen): Focus on business, economics, and marketing.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): Shorter 2-year version, a bit more practical and Ô¨Çexible,
often for those who prefer a slightly diÔ¨Äerent academic pace.
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
If you're more practically oriented or want to start working sooner:
You combine school with internships or apprenticeships.
Fields include carpentry, electrician, IT-support, healthcare, gastronomy, mechanics, and many
others.
Many vocational programs now have good career prospects and decent salaries ‚Äî especially in
areas where Denmark needs skilled workers.
Ûæ†∞ Kombinationsforl√∏b (Kombineret ungdomsuddannelse)
There are also hybrid programs if you‚Äôre not 100% sure whether you want an academic or vocational
path. For example:
EUX (combines vocational training with a general upper secondary education).
Ûæ†± Other options
International Baccalaureate (IB) ‚Äî taught in English, can be an advantage if you consider studying
or working internationally.
Boarding schools (efterskole or kostgymnasium) ‚Äî gives you life experience and personal growth.
My Recommendation (based on your brief info)
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born in Denmark, and just Ô¨Ånished folkeskole, you have all doors open.
Here are a few personal factors you might consider:
If you enjoy studying, reading, and would like to leave open the possibility of university: STX or
HTX.
If you're curious about business, Ô¨Ånance, or marketing: HHX.
If you want a faster way into work, and like hands-on learning: EUD or EUX.
If you want strong English skills and international options: IB.
Since your parents are originally from Iran, you may also think about how your cultural background
could be an advantage ‚Äî for example:
Languages (Persian, English, Danish = great skillset)
International perspectives
Potential future work in Ô¨Åelds like diplomacy, international business, or cross-cultural work

I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Iraq. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing your situation ‚Äî you're at a very important stage, and it's great you're thinking
carefully about your next step.
Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school (which in Denmark is typically Folkeskolen up to 9th or 10th
grade), you now have several main options depending a bit on your interests, strengths, and long-term
goals. I‚Äôll lay them out simply:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF) ‚Äî If you're interested in higher education later
STX (Almen studentereksamen): General upper secondary education. Broad subjects like science,
languages, social studies, and humanities. Good if you're unsur e or want university options open.
HHX (Handelsskolen): Focuses on business, economics, and international trade. Useful if you're
interested in business, Ô¨Ånance, marketing, or entrepreneurship.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technology, science, IT, and engineering. Great if you like
technical subjects or want to work with science or technology.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A bit shorter (2 years), often more practice-oriented. A good
option if you want to move quicker towards certain professions or professional education.
‚úÖ Why choose this path?
It gives you many options later: university, professional bachelor, academy programs, etc.
Ûæ†Ø Vocational Education (EUD, EUX) ‚Äî If you want to work sooner, or like practical
work
EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse): Vocational training for becoming a skilled worker (carpenter,
electrician, hairdresser, mechanic, chef, etc.).
EUX: Combines vocational education with some academic subjects so you can also continue
studying afterward if you want.
‚úÖ Why choose this path?
You learn both in school and on the job. Denmark has a strong system for apprenticeships. This is great
if you like practical, hands-on work but still want options for further education later.
Ûæ†∞ Something more unique: International or special schools
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Some schools oÔ¨Äer international programs (IB ‚Äî International Baccalaureate), which can be
helpful if you're considering studies abroad or an international career.
Some youth programs combine school and sports, arts, or other interests.
A few personal factors you might consider:
Are you more academic or practical?
Do you enjoy school subjects like math, languages, business, technology, or something creative?
Do you have a dream job or area already in mind?
Would you like to start working earlier or go to university later?
My general advice (based on your age and situation):
Since you‚Äôre 16, Ô¨Çuent in Danish, and just Ô¨Ånishing primary school, Gymnasium (STX, HHX, or HTX) is
often a very good default choice unless you strongly prefer practical work. It gives you broad options
later.

Jamaica,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Jamaica. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî you're at a really important point in your life, and it's good
that you're thinking ahead.
Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school (which I assume is folkeskolen in Denmark), your next step is
typically one of the youth education programs (ungdomsuddannelser). The best path depends a bit
on your interests, strengths, and long-term goals, but let me walk you through your main options:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
If you enjoy academic subjects and might want to go to university later, this is a common choice.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad and traditional academic education ‚Äî strong in
humanities, science, and social sciences.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, marketing, and languages.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen): Focus on science, technology, IT, and technical subjects.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): Shorter (2 years), more practical, often for those who want a
faster route to higher education or speciÔ¨Åc professions.
‚úÖ Recommended if you:
Like studying academic subjects
Want to keep your options open for university
Enjoy a balance of theory and practice
Ûæ†Ø Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD/EGU/EUX)
If you want to learn a profession and start working sooner, these are very good options.
EUD: Learn a speciÔ¨Åc trade (e.g., carpenter, chef, electrician, hairdresser, mechanic, etc.)
EUX: Combination of vocational training and general education, allowing you to both work and
pursue further studies later.
‚úÖ Recommended if you:
Prefer practical learning
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Want to get a job quickly
Like working with your hands, people, or technology
Ûæ†∞ Other paths:
International Baccalaureate (IB): If you're interested in a more international education, possibly
in English.
Preparatory Basic Education (FGU): For extra preparation if you‚Äôre not fully ready for youth
education yet.
Military preparatory courses, creative schools, or sports schools depending on personal
interests.
A few personal reÔ¨Çections for you:
You‚Äôre bilingual (Danish + English), which is a huge advantage both in Denmark and internationally.
Your multicultural background can give you extra perspectives in Ô¨Åelds like business, healthcare,
politics, education, or international relations.
Denmark needs people in both academic and skilled trades ‚Äî both paths can lead to good careers.

Denmark and you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you actually have quite a few good options depending on your
interests, strengths, and future plans. Let me break it down a bit to help you think it through:
Ûæ†Æ The ""normal"" path: Secondary education (Ungdomsuddannelse)
After primary school (Folkeskole), most students in Denmark choose one of these:
a) Gymnasiale uddannelser (General upper secondary education)
STX (Studentereksamen): Broad academic education ‚Äî good if you're interested in university
later on. You get courses in languages, science, humanities, and social studies.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination): Focus on business, economics, and international trade.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination): Focus on science, technology, and IT.
HF (Higher Preparatory Examination): Shorter and more practical, often for those who want to
go to university but prefer a bit less academic pressure.
b) Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education and training, VET)
Learn a trade while working (apprenticeship model). This is great if you already have a clear idea of
a speciÔ¨Åc job (crafts, health, IT, culinary, etc.)
Denmark is very good at combining practical training with theory.
Ûæ†Ø Alternative or International Paths
Since you also have a Japanese background, you might also consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB): Taught in English, internationally recognized, and very good
preparation for university worldwide. There are IB schools in Denmark.
Japanese language studies or exchange programs: If you're interested in connecting more with
Japan, you could consider taking Japanese formally as part of your education or even explore
exchange programs in Japan later.

Thank you for sharing your background ‚Äî that helps a lot. Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school in

education to pursue. Let me outline some options based on the Danish system, your situation, and
some things to consider:
Ûæ†Æ Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
These are great if you want to keep many doors open for futur e university studies:
STX (Almen studentereksamen)
Broad and academic, focuses on languages, sciences, humanities.
Good if you're not sure yet what you want to study later.
Fits well if you enjoy school subjects, theory, and a wide range of topics.
HHX (H√∏jere Handelseksamen)
Focus on business, economics, and international studies.

Denmark has a strong tradition for vocational education, and skilled workers are in high demand.

Ûæ†∞ EUX (Vocational + General Upper Secondary)
A mix of vocational education and academic subjects.
You get both a skilled trade and the option to continue to higher education.
Very good if you want both practical skills and futur e Ô¨Çexibility.
Ûæ†± Other Considerations
Language skills: Being Ô¨Çuent in Danish is a huge plus. If you also speak Kazakh or Russian, that

more into business, technology, health, social work, or creative arts?
Long-term goals: University? Quick job? Own business? Family business?
My general advice:
Since you're young, born in Denmark, and have full language skills, I would probably recommend STX,
HHX, or HTX depending on your interests ‚Äî unless you already know that you prefer a more practical
education, in which case EUX can be a very smart choice.

You‚Äôre considering studying or working abroad later.
You enjoy learning in English.
You like a global perspective.
Ûæ†± Other paths
10th grade (10. klasse): Optional ‚Äî can give you more time to decide and prepare.
Folk high schools (H√∏jskole): Non-formal education, often for personal development, usually for
18+.
Personal Considerations
Since your parents are from Kenya, you might also think about:
Combining Danish and international education (especially if you might one day study/work in
Kenya, Europe or elsewhere).
Building strong skills in both Danish and English ‚Äî very valuable in Denmark and internationally.
My Recommendation (based on your age, situation, and Ô¨Çuency in Danish):
Start by considering a gymnasial uddannelse (STX, HHX, or HTX), depending on your interests.
If you're not sure yet, STX gives you a very broad foundation.
If you like business or economics: HHX.
If you're into technology or science: HTX.
These options will give you many futur e paths, both in Denmark and internationally.
üëâ If you tell me a bit more about your interests (science? business? tech? languages? creative arts?), I
can give you a more speciÔ¨Åc recommendation.

Ûæ†Ø EUD / Vocational Education and Training (Erhvervsuddannelse)
Duration: 2-4 years (depending on program)
Focus: Combines school and apprenticeship. You learn a trade while working.
Good if: You want to get a job faster, learn by doing, and enter Ô¨Åelds like carpentry, plumbing,

If you‚Äôre not sure yet, I‚Äôd suggest looking into STX or HHX, since they keep the most doors open. If you

and academic.

Thanks for sharing your background ‚Äî it gives a good foundation to give advice tailored to you. Since
you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and are considering your next step, here are your main
educational options and what they can lead to:
üéì 1. Gymnasiale Uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These are the most common paths if you‚Äôre thinking about going to university in the futur e.
A. STX (Studentereksamen)
Focus: Broad academic education (humanities, social sciences, natural sciences).
Good for: If you're not sure what you want yet or want to keep doors open.
Leads to: University, business school, etc.
B. HHX (H√∏jere Handelseksamen)
Focus: Business, economics, international trade.
Good for: If you're interested in business, marketing, Ô¨Ånance, or starting your own company.
Leads to: Business and economics studies or entrepreneurship.
C. HTX (H√∏jere Teknisk Eksamen)
Focus: Technology, natural sciences, engineering.
Good for: If you're into tech, IT, engineering, or science.
Leads to: Engineering degrees, IT studies, and technical careers.
D. HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
Focus: Shorter and more practical than STX.
Good for: If you prefer a less academic and more career-oriented route, or you want to Ô¨Ånish
quicker.
Leads to: Professional bachelor programs, teacher training, nursing, etc.
üõ† 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education ‚Äì EUD)
Focus: Hands-on training in a trade (e.g., electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, chef).
Good for: If you like working practically and want to get into a job quickly.
Leads to: Skilled trade jobs or possibly further education (EUX = vocational + academic).
EUX: A combined vocational + academic program
Gives you: A vocational education AND a studentereksamen, so you can both work and go to
university later.
üí° How to choose?
Ask yourself:
Do I want to study more academically, or work with my hands?
Am I more interested in business, science, tech, or practical trades?
Do I want to go to university, or get into a job quicker?
üí¨ Special Tip:
Being Ô¨Çuent in both Danish and possibly Latvian (and maybe English), you could also think about
international careers, language studies, or EU-related work. Denmark is part of the EU, and your Latvian
background could be a strength if you go into diplomacy, international relations, or law.
‚úÖ Recommendation based on your general proÔ¨Åle:
If you‚Äôre not sure yet, I‚Äôd suggest looking into STX or HHX, since they keep the most doors open. If you
prefer tech or science, HTX might suit you well. If you're more practical, EUX is a great mix of hands-on
and academic.

science, languages, social studies, or humanities.
Types:
STX (Studentereksamen): General academic education with a wide range of subjects.
HHX (H√∏jere Handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, and languages.
HTX (H√∏jere Teknisk Eksamen): Focus on technical subjects like IT, natural sciences, and
technology.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A shorter, more Ô¨Çexible 2-year program. Good for more
mature students or those wanting a quicker path to further education.
Best for you if: You like school-style learning, enjoy academic subjects, and think you may want to go to
university later.
üîπ 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì VET/EUD)
This is a more hands-on path, where you combine school and apprenticeship in a company. It leads to a
skilled trade or profession.
Examples of programs:
Electrician
Carpenter

your hands or helping people.
üîπ 3. Kombinerede Uddannelser (Combination Programs)
There are also EUX-programs, which combine VET with academic subjects, giving you both a vocational
qualiÔ¨Åcation and eligibility for university.
Best for you if: You want both practical training and the option to pursue further studies.
üîπ 4. International Options
With your Liechtenstein background, you might consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB): An English-language academic program recognized worldwide.
Studying abroad later on (e.g., in Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Austria, etc.)‚Äîyou might have cultural
or language ties to those places.
Best for you if: You're aiming for international university studies or careers, or want to keep your
options very open.
Recommendations Based on Your Info:

some tailored suggestions:
If you're still Ô¨Åguring out your interests, STX or HHX might be a good general path to keep many
options open.
If you're more practical and want to start learning a trade, consider a VET program or EUX for
Ô¨Çexibility.
If you‚Äôre ambitious and conÔ¨Ådent in English, the IB could be a great springboard to international
opportunities.
What You Should Consider:
Ask yourself:
Do I enjoy academic learning or hands-on work?
Do I want to go to university?
What subjects or activities excite me most?
Do I want to work right after school, or study more?

you depends on your interests, strengths, and career goals.
Here are the most common options:
üéì 1. Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX) ‚Äì General Upper Secondary Education
These programs usually last 3 years and prepare you for university.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broadest option ‚Äì covers humanities, sciences, and social
studies. Good if you‚Äôre unsure what you want to study later.
HHX (H√∏jere Handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, and international trade. Great if
you're into business or want to become an entrepreneur.
HTX (H√∏jere Teknisk Eksamen): Focus on science, technology, and innovation. Good for those
interested in engineering, IT, or biotech.
üìå Recommended if: You‚Äôre academically strong and interested in going to university or higher
education later.
üîß 2. EUD / EUX ‚Äì Vocational Education and Training
EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse): Hands-on training for a speciÔ¨Åc job (e.g., electrician, mechanic,
hairdresser, chef). Includes apprenticeships.
EUX: A combo of vocational training + gymnasium-level academic subjects. Lets you both learn a
trade and qualify for university.
üìå Recommended if: You prefer practical learning or already have a career in mind, but want to keep
doors open.
üé® 3. Efterskole / 10th Grade (10. klasse)
Some students choose to do an extra year (10th grade), especially at an efterskole, which can focus on
academics, sports, arts, or personal development.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2üìå Recommended if: You‚Äôre not 100% sure what to do next and want to grow personally or
academically in a more relaxed environment.
üëÄ My advice based on your background:
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish and were born and raised in Denmark, all options are open to you.
If you‚Äôre ambitious, open to university later, and enjoy school, I‚Äôd suggest STX or EUX.
If you like working with your hands or want to get a job faster, EUD is a strong and respected
route.
If you're unsure, 10th grade at an efterskole might give you the space to explore.
Would you like me to help you compare speciÔ¨Åc options (like STX vs EUX), or help you think through your
interests and career ideas to narrow it down more?

Malaysia,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Malaysia.

Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thanks for sharing your background! Since you've just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and you're
16, you're likely deciding between the main post-primary options in the Danish education system. Here's
a breakdown to help guide your decision, tailored to your situation:
üéì Main Educational Paths After Primary School in Denmark
1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These are academic programs that prepare you for university.
STX ‚Äì General upper secondary (focus on science, humanities, social science).
HHX ‚Äì Business-focused (economy, marketing, international trade).
HTX ‚Äì Technological/scientiÔ¨Åc focus (engineering, IT, biotech).
HF ‚Äì Shorter 2-year version, often used as a second chance or for more mature students.
‚úÖ Good if:
You enjoy schoolwork and academic subjects.
You‚Äôre thinking of going to university later.
You want to keep your options open.
2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD)
Hands-on learning combined with internshi ps.
Leads to becoming a skilled worker (e.g., electrician, carpenter, chef, IT-supporter).
Often shorter and more practical.
‚úÖ Good if:
You prefer practical work over theory.
You want to start working sooner.
You might still have the option to go to ‚ÄúEUX‚Äù (combination of vocational + academic).
3. EUX ‚Äì The Best of Both Worlds
Combines vocational training with academic courses.

‚úÖ Good if:
You want job skills and the chance to study more later.
You're not sure if you want to go to university or start working.
ü§î How to Choose? Ask Yourself:
Do I enjoy academic subjects like math, science, history, languages?
Do I like hands-on work and learning by doing?
Do I want to go to university later on, or would I rather start earning money sooner?
Do I learn better in a classroom, or by doing real tasks?
üë§ Your SpeciÔ¨Åc Case
You're Ô¨Çuent in Danish and born here, so you have equal access to all options.
If you're interested in both practical and academic paths, EUX might be ideal.
If you have a strong academic interest (e.g., science, business, languages), consider STX, HHX, or
HTX.
If you prefer learning a trade and entering the workforce sooner, go for EUD.
‚úÖ My Recommendation:
Since you're 16 and just Ô¨Ånishing primary school (which is a bit older than typical), and if you're unsur e
what you want long-term:
üëâ Explore EUX or HF. These are Ô¨Çexible and give you a mix of theory and practice or a shorter
academic path that can still lead to university.

You can later combine it with EUX, which gives both a vocational qualiÔ¨Åcation and access to university
studies.
‚úà 3. International options or studies abroad
You could consider:
International Baccalaureate (IB): OÔ¨Äered at some Danish schools, all in English.
Studying part of your education in Malta or another EU country (Denmark supports some mobility
through Erasmus+).
üìå Things to Consider:
What subjects excite you the most? (e.g., science, business, art, languages)
Do you prefer theory or practical learning?
Are you interested in working soon or continuing to higher education?
Would you consider eventually studying or working in Malta or internationally?
‚úÖ Recommended Next Step:
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish and just Ô¨Ånished primary school, I recommend you:
1. Talk to a vejleder (educational counselor) at your school or UU-vejledning.
2. Visit educational fairs or open houses at gymnasiums and vocational schools.
3. Try a ‚Äúbrobygning‚Äù (bridge-building course) to test out a few educational tracks before deciding.
If you tell me what subjects or careers interest you right now, I can help you narrow it down even more!

post-primary education options. Here's a breakdown of your choices, along with some guidance based
on your age, language Ô¨Çuency, and background:
üéì Main Educational Paths in Denmark After Primary School
1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education ‚Äì Academic Track)
These prepare you for university and are usua lly 3 years long. Good if you like academic subjects.
STX (Studentereksamen): Broad academic program; good for university preparation.

want to study later but don‚Äôt want a full 3-year program.
‚úÖ Recommended if:
You enjoy academic work, are open to studying at university later, and want broad career options.
2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì VET)
These combine school with apprenticeship (praktikplads) in a company. Lasts 3‚Äì5 years depending on
the Ô¨Åeld.

You can still access higher education later (like Erhvervsakademi or even university with
supplementary courses).
‚úÖ Recommended if:

change discussions)
üí° Final Advice:

What subjects do you enjoy the most?
Do you prefer theory or practical work?

Do I enjoy school, reading, writing, and exams? ‚Üí  Gymnasiale uddannelser
Do I prefer hands-on, real-world tasks and learning by doing? ‚Üí  VET / EUX
Am I interested in business, tech, healthcare, or something speciÔ¨Åc already?
üîÅ You Can Change Paths
One of the best things about the Danish system is Ô¨Çexibility. Even if you start in STX, HHX, or VET, you
can often pivot later. You're not stuck.
Final Recommendation (based on your age and situation):
If you‚Äôre unsure and want to keep your options open, I recommend STX or HHX ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre
curious about university or broader career choices later.
If you're already into a Ô¨Åeld like IT, engineering, hospitality, or trades, look at EUX ‚Äî it's a smart
combo of vocational + academic learning.
Would you like help comparing speciÔ¨Åc schools or programs near where you live in Denmark? I can help
with that too.

Thanks for sharing that! You‚Äôre at a key decision point, and your options now will shape not only your
education but also your future career path ‚Äî but the good news is that Denmark‚Äôs education system
gives you several Ô¨Çexible routes.
üéì Your Options After Primary School in Denmark (Folkeskole)
Since you‚Äôve Ô¨Ånished 9th grade (or maybe 10th?), you now have a few main options. Here's a breakdown,
including my recommendation depending on your interests and goals.
üí° 1. Gymnasiale Uddannelser (General Upper Secondary
Education)
This is a common path if you‚Äôre not 100% sure yet what you want, or you think you might want to go to
university later.
Options include:
STX: General upper secondary education ‚Äì broad, academic. Great if you like hum anities, social
sciences, or natural sciences.
HHX: Business-oriented ‚Äì economics, international trade, etc. Good for entrepreneurship or
business careers.
HTX: Technical and science-oriented ‚Äì good for engineering, tech, and science interests.
HF: Shorter (2 years), more practical than STX ‚Äì good if you want to work sooner or go into speciÔ¨Åc
higher education programs later.
‚úÖ Recommended if: You want to keep your options open, enjoy school-based learning, or aim to go to
university in Denmark or abroad.
üîß 2. Erhvervsuddannelse (VET ‚Äì Vocational Education and
Training)
This is great if you're more hands-on and want to work sooner in skilled trades or technical Ô¨Åelds (e.g.,
electrician, mechanic, chef, IT support).
Takes 3‚Äì5 years depending on your path.
Often includes apprenticeships (praktikplads).
Can also lead to EUX, which combines VET with upper secondary exam (gives you access to
university too).
‚úÖ Recommended if: You like practical work and want to get into a profession faster ‚Äî or combine it
with academic possibilities (via EUX).
üåç 3. International Options / Studying Abroad (or in English)
Since your background includes Montenegro, you might also consider:
Studying abroad in the Balkans or elsewhere in Europe
Taking an international education in Denmark (like IB ‚Äì International Baccalaureate)
‚úÖ Recommended if: You‚Äôre interested in international environments, languages, or possibly living
abroad in the future.
üéØ How to Decide?

Do I enjoy school, reading, writing, and exams? ‚Üí  Gymnasiale uddannelser

Thanks for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps give good, grounded advice. Since you‚Äôve just
Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark (which goes up to 9th or 10th grade, depending on your track), the
next step typically depends on your interests, strengths, and goals.
Here are your main options in the Danish education system after primary school:
üéì 1. Gymnasiale Uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education ‚Äì Academic)
This is the most common path if you're aiming for university later on.
The three main types:
STX (Almen studentereksamen) ‚Äì Broad academic focus (humanities, sciences, social sciences).
Good if you're unsure or want a wide range of options later.

(arbejdspraktik).
Examples:
Electrician, carpenter, mechanic, chef, hairdresser, health care assistant.

‚úÖ Good for you if:

10th grade ‚Äì Optional, but useful if you want more time to decide, improve your grades, or get

IB (International Baccalaureate) ‚Äì If you're academically strong and want an international angle
(taught in English).
Efterskole ‚Äì A one-year boarding school for personal and social development, often with a special
focus (sports, music, arts, etc.). Great for growing personally and trying new things.
üìå What You Should Consider:
What are your interests? Are you drawn to science, people, hands-on work, business, or arts?
How do you learn best? Do you prefer books and theory, or doing things in real life?
Do you want to go to university? If yes, then gymnasiale uddannelser are usua lly required.
üí¨ Examples Based on Your Background:
If you're curious about global aÔ¨Äairs or want to give back to communities (in Denmark or
Mozambique), STX with social science focus or IB might be good.
If you're practical and enjoy working with your hands, maybe an EUD with EUX to keep university
as an option.
If you‚Äôre into tech, HTX could be a great Ô¨Åt ‚Äî especially with Denmark‚Äôs strong tech job market.
‚úÖ My Suggestion:

move ‚Äî it keeps your options open while you explore more about yourself. Talk to your UU-vejleder

Do I want to go to university later?
What subjects do I enjoy most?
Do I want to start working soon, or study longer?
üí° Personal Recommendation
If you're unsure but have decent grades and enjoy school:
Go for STX or HHX, as they keep most options open ‚Äî including university, business, and
international careers.
If you're more hands-on and want to start working or doing something practical:
Try EUD or EUX ‚Äî it's a respected and solid path, and you can always build on it later.
If you‚Äôd like, I can help you compare speciÔ¨Åc programs near where you live in Denmark, or go into more
detail based on your interests. Want to tell me what subjects you like best?

multicultural identity‚Äîthis can be a big strength, especially in Ô¨Åelds that value communication,

1. Gymnasiale Uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education ‚Äì Academic Path)

Main types:

Thanks for sharing that ‚Äî it's great you're already thinking carefully about your next steps! Since you‚Äôre
16, Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark, and Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you have several good options within the
Danish education system. Your decision depends on your interests, career goals, and whether you enjoy
academic study, hands-on work, or a mix of both.
Here's a breakdown of your main options after primary school:
1. Gymnasiale Uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education ‚Äì Academic Path)
These prepare you for university. Choose this if you‚Äôre interested in academic subjects and want to go to
university later.
Main types:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad, academic education with subjects like literature, history,
math, and science.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen): Focuses on business, economics, and languages.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen): Focus on science, technology, and innovation.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): A 2-year general education, more compact and practical.
‚ö† Good for: university dreams, interest in theory, or if you're unsur e and want Ô¨Çexibility.
2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì VET)
These prepare you for a skilled trade or craft. You combine school with real work experience through
apprenticeships.
Examples:
Electrician, carpenter, mechanic
Healthcare assistant (sosu), child care worker
Chef, baker, hairdresser
‚ö† Good for: practical learners, people who want to work sooner, or want hands-on skills.
3. Kombinationsuddannelser (EUX)
A mix of vocational training and academic studies. You get both a trade qualiÔ¨Åcation and the right to
apply to university.
‚ö† Good for: students who want the best of both worlds.
Other considerations:
What do you enjoy? Subjects, projects, school environment?
Do you want to work soon or study longer?
Do you have a dream job or role model?
Are you open to moving cities if needed for school?
‚ú® My recommendation:
If you‚Äôre unsure but open to university later, STX is a safe and Ô¨Çexible choice. If you already know you
love working with your hands or helping people, VET or EUX could be perfect.
If you tell me a bit more about your interests ‚Äî like subjects you enjoy, hobbies, or job dreams ‚Äî I can
help you choose even more speciÔ¨Åcally.

Choose STX if you're curious about a broad range of academic subjects and want to keep lots of
options open.
Choose HTX if you like science, tech, or engineering and want a more modern, project-based
school environment.
If you'd like, I can also help you compare speciÔ¨Åc schools near where you live or explore career options
tied to each path.
Would you like help with that? Or want to tell me a bit more about your interests?

After folkeskole (primary and lower secondary school), Danish students typically choose between the
following options:
1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
These are academic programs that prepare you for higher education (university or professional
bachelor's). There are four types:
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad academic focus ‚Äî sciences, humanities, and languages.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, and international trade.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen): Focus on science and technology.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): Shorter (2-year) program, good if you want a quicker route to

2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training, EUD)
Combines school with hands-on apprenticeships in a company. Great if you want to become a
craftsman, technician, hairdresser, chef, etc.
üß≠ What to Consider
Here are some questions that might help narrow down the path:
Do you like academic subjects and plan to go to university? ‚Üí Gymnasiale programs are likely
best.
Are you more hands-on and want to work earlier or get into a trade? ‚Üí Vocational training
(EUD) could be a good Ô¨Åt.

Do you want to keep your options open while deciding? ‚Üí STX is the most general and Ô¨Çexible.
üåç Your Unique Background
Being Ô¨Çuent in both Danish and (likely) Russian gives you a multicultural edge. Some paths that could
beneÔ¨Åt from your background:
HHX or STX with a focus on languages or international studies ‚Äì your bilingual ability is a big
plus.
Careers in translation, diplomacy, international business, or tourism.
You might also consider international baccalaureate (IB) if you‚Äôre academically strong and want a
more international experience (some Danish schools oÔ¨Äer it).
‚úÖ My Recommendation (Based on Your Age, Skills & Background)
Unless you already know you want to pursue a trade or vocational job soon, I‚Äôd recommend:
‚û§ STX (Almen studentereksamen)
Why?
It keeps all your future options open (university, business, science, language careers).
You can choose a studieretning (study line) that matches your interests ‚Äî e.g., languages, social
sciences, or science.
It Ô¨Åts well with being bilingual and opens the door to international paths later on.
If you already have a clear interest in a subject like technology or business, HTX or HHX might be even
better.

Rwanda,"Uddannelsesvalg i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Rwanda. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thanks for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that helps a lot. Since you're 16 and just Ô¨Ånished primary
school in Denmark (which likely includes the Folkeskole up to 9th or 10th grade), you‚Äôre now at a key
decision point where you choose between several main educational paths. Here's a breakdown of your
options and what might be best for you depending on your interests, strengths, and goals:
üéì 1. Gymnasium (STX, HHX, HTX, HF)
These are general upper secondary education programs that prepare you for university.
STX (Alment Gymnasium): Strong in humanities, sciences, and social studies.
HHX (Business Gymnasium): Focus on business, economics, and languages.
HTX (Technical Gymnasium): Focus on science, technology, and innovation.
HF: A shorter 2-year general program, often for students who want a faster route to speciÔ¨Åc higher
education paths.
‚úÖ Good if:
You want to go to university.
You enjoy academic subjects.
You‚Äôre not sure yet what you want to do, but want to keep options open.
üõ† 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (VET ‚Äì Vocational Education and Training)
Practical, job-oriented education paths that combine school and apprenticeship in a company.
Examples:
Electrician, mechanic, hairdresser, carpenter, IT supporter, healthcare assistant.
‚úÖ Good if:
You want to start working earlier.
You like practical work more than academic study.
You‚Äôre interested in a speciÔ¨Åc trade or job.

A hybrid option where you get both a vocational education and the chance to go to university.
‚úÖ Good if:
You want hands-on experience but still want the option to study further.
You‚Äôre ambitious and don‚Äôt mind a challenging path.
üîé Recommendations Based on You:
Since you‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish and likely bicultural, you might have strengths in communication,
languages, or cultural understanding. That can be a huge asset!
Here are a few scenarios:
  If you‚Äôre academically curious and might want to go to university:
STX or HHX would be strong choices.
STX gives you a broad education and Ô¨Çexibility to study anything later.
HHX is great if you're curious about business, marketing, or international trade ‚Äî and maybe
interested in connections between Denmark and Rwanda.
üîß If you're more hands-on or want a job quickly:
Erhvervsuddannelse (VET) in something practical like tech, construction, or healthcare.
Or go for EUX to keep university an option too.
üåç If you're thinking about international work or giving back to your parents' country:
A global business or development studies path via HHX or STX could help.
Languages (French or English), economics, and global studies are strong subjects to focus on.
Would you like help picking between STX, HHX, HTX, HF, EUX, or VET based on your interests or career
dreams? If you share what you enjoy doing or subjects you're best at, I can give you a more personal

Thanks for sharing your background‚Äîthat‚Äôs a great starting point. In Denmark, after Ô¨Ånishing primary
school (folkeskole), you typically have several educational options depending on your interests,
strengths, and future goals. Here's a breakdown of the main paths, along with recommendations
depending on your interests and ambitions:
üéì 1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
These are academic programs that prepare you for university.
Most common types:
STX (Alment gymnasium): Focuses on humanities, sciences, and social studies. Good if you're not
sure yet what you want to study later.
HHX (Handelsskolens gymnasium): Business- and economics-focused. Good for careers in
Ô¨Ånance, marketing, or entrepreneurship.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technology and natural sciences. Great for engineering, IT,
or science paths.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): Shorter (2 years), more practical. For those who want
university access but not a full 3-year gymnasium.
‚úÖ Recommended if: You enjoy academic subjects and want the option to go to university later.
üõ† 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education & Training ‚Äì EUD)
Practical education with apprenticeships‚Äîbecome a skilled worker (e.g., electrician, chef, mechanic,
carpenter, healthcare assistant).
Combines school and on-the-job training.
Takes around 3-4 years.
You can still take ‚Äúeux‚Äù and later apply to university.
‚úÖ Recommended if: You like hands-on work and want to start earning earlier.
üí° 3. EUX (Vocational + Academic Education)
A hybrid of the two above. You get both a vocational education and a qualiÔ¨Åcation that allows you to go
to university.
‚úÖ Recommended if: You want both practical skills and the option to continue studying.
üåç Other things to think about:

and some guidance to help you choose what Ô¨Åts best:
  Danish Education Pathways After 9th/10th Grade
You usually have three main options after folkeskole:
üéì 1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
These prepare you for university.
STX (Studentereksamen): Focus on a mix of humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. Ideal if
you enjoy academic subjects.
HHX (H√∏jere Handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, and languages. Good if you're
interested in commerce or entrepreneurship.
HTX (H√∏jere Teknisk Eksamen): Focus on technology, science, and innovation. Good if you like STEM
subjects.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A shorter 2-year option, more practical, for students who may
not want a full 3-year program.
‚û° Choose this path if:
You enjoy studying theory, want to go to university, and are not yet sure what job you want.
üõ† 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì EUD)
These combine school with hands-on training at a workplace. You‚Äôll become a skilled worker (fagl√¶rt).
Examples:
Electrician, carpenter, chef, mechanic, health worker, IT-supporter.
‚û° Choose this path if:
You want to start working sooner, enjoy practical skills, and maybe want to become self-employed or
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2take a short path to higher education later (EUX option combines EUD with general subjects).
‚öñ 3. EUX ‚Äì The ‚Äúdual‚Äù option
This combines vocational education with general education subjects, so you can both work as a skilled
professional and still have access to university.
‚û° Choose this if:
You want the best of both worlds: job-ready skills and futur e academic opportunities.
üë§ Based on What You Said...
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born and raised in Denmark, and have both local and Serbian cultural
background, you‚Äôre well positioned for many paths. Here are a few things to ask yourself:
Do you enjoy academic subjects like history, math, science, or literature?
Are you more interested in hands-on, practical work or theoretical thinking?
Do you already have a career interest (e.g. business, IT, healthcare, construction)?
Do you want to go to university later or start working sooner?
‚úÖ My Recommendation (based on common paths and Ô¨Çexibility):
If you're unsure but want to keep your options open:
‚û§ STX or EUX
STX gives the most Ô¨Çexibility for university. EUX gives you both work-ready skills and
university access.
If you're hands-on and want a faster path to a career:
‚û§ EUD with a strong profession (like IT, electrician, or healthcare)
If you're into business or want to start your own company one day:

Thanks for sharing your background‚Äîit's great that you're thinking ahead about your futur e. Since
you're 16, just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark, and are Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you have several good
options for your next educational step. Here's a breakdown to help guide your decision, depending on
your interests, goals, and learning style:
üéì Main Educational Paths After Primary School in Denmark
1. Gymnasiale Uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These are academically focused and prepare you for university.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad academic focus. Good if you're not sure yet what to
study later.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen): Business and economics focus. Great if you're interested in
international trade, marketing, Ô¨Ånance, or entrepreneurship.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen): Focus on science and technology. Good if you like math,
physics, biology, or IT.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): Shorter (2 years), more practical. Good if you want to
keep doors open but need a quicker route to further education.
‚úÖ Choose this if: You enjoy studying, might want to go to university, and like theoretical learning.
2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì
EUD)
More hands-on. You learn a trade or profession and often split your time between school and
apprenticeship.
Examples: Electrician, carpenter, chef, mechanic, social and health care worker (SOSU), IT
technician.
Usually takes 3-5 years depending on the program.
‚úÖ Choose this if: You prefer practical learning, want to enter the workforce sooner, or are
interested in a speciÔ¨Åc skilled trade.
3. EUX (Combination of EUD + Gymnasial Exam)
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2A combo program where you get both vocational training and a general upper secondary exam (like
a mix of EUD and STX).
‚úÖ Choose this if: You want to keep the option of going to university and want a trade or hands-on
career path.
üåç Your Background as a Strength
Being bilingual and bicultural (Danish-Slovak) can be a huge asset in business, international
studies, diplomacy, or tourism.
If you‚Äôre interested, you could consider Ô¨Åelds like translation, international relations, or cross-
cultural communication.

position to choose a path that matches your interests, strengths, and futur e goals.
In Denmark, after primary school (folkeskolen), you typically choose between three main educational
paths:

Ideal if: You enjoy academic subjects and might want to go to university later.
There are a few types:

HTX: Focus on science, technology, and engineering.
Good if you're: Curious, enjoy subjects like history, math, biology, literature, etc., and want Ô¨Çexibility in
university choices later.
üõ† 2. Erhvervsuddannelse (Vocational Education & Training - EUD)
Ideal if: You prefer practical work and want to learn a trade or profession directly.
Examples:
Electrician
Carpenter
Hairdresser
Chef
Health care assistant
Often includes internships in real companies (praktik).
Good if you're: Hands-on, like working with tools, people, or doing something physical and practical.

These are more tailored programs for those who may not Ô¨Åt into traditional school paths and need a
more Ô¨Çexible, practical, or supportive setting.
How to Choose?
Here are some questions to ask yourself:
Do you like school subjects, or do you prefer learning by doing?
Are you interested in going to university in the futur e?
Do you already have a passion (like mechanics, design, health care, business)?
Do you want to start working sooner or study longer?
My Recommendation (based on what I know so far):
Since you're still young and just Ô¨Ånished primary school, gymnasium (STX or HHX) might be a good
next step if you're open to continuing school and want to keep your options open ‚Äî especially if
you're not 100% sure yet what you want to do later.
But if you're more practical or already have an idea for a job you‚Äôd love (like chef, mechanic, or
designer), going for a vocational path (EUD) could be perfect ‚Äî and Denmark's system makes it easy to
switch later or take adult education if your goals change.

Talk to a student counselor (uddannelsesvejleder)
Try out a short introduction course (brobygning)

even more.

Focus: Broad academic subjects ‚Äì languages, sciences, social studies.
Best for: Students considering university or a wide range of careers.
Pros: Opens many doors; respected; good if you're unsur e of your long-term plans.
Challenge: More theoretical than practical.
‚úÖ Recommendation if you enjoy school subjects, want to keep your options open, or aim for university.
üß™ 2. HTX (Teknisk Studentereksamen) ‚Äì Technical Upper
Secondary Education
Focus: Science, technology, and practical applications.
Best for: Students interested in engineering, IT, natural sciences.
Pros: Practical + academic mix; strong prep for tech careers or studies.
Challenge: Can be demanding in math and science.
‚úÖ Great if you like tech, science, or want a career in STEM Ô¨Åelds.
üíº 3. HHX (Handelsgymnasium) ‚Äì Business-Oriented Education

Best for: Students interested in business, Ô¨Ånance, or management.
Pros: Useful for future studies or jobs in business.

‚úÖ Strong choice if you're into business, sales, or entrepreneurship.
üõ† 4. EUX / EUD ‚Äì Vocational Education and Training
Focus: Trades and professions (electrician, mechanic, healthcare, etc.)
Best for: Hands-on learners who want to enter the workforce quickly or become skilled workers.
EUX Option: Combines vocational training with subjects from gymnasium, so you can go to
university afterward.
Pros: You can start earning earlier; strong job market demand.
Challenge: Less theory, more hands-on.
‚úÖ Ideal if you like practical work or want a clear path to a career without university.
‚úç How to Choose?
Ask yourself:
Do I want to study more theory (like math, history, literature)?
Am I more practical and hands-on?
Do I already know what kind of job or education I want?
Do I want to go to university later?
üåç Bonus Tip (as someone with a multicultural background):
Denmark values diversity, and there are mentorship programs and career guidance services that
support young people with immigrant backgrounds.
You might also look into bridging programs (brobygning), where you can try diÔ¨Äerent educations
for a few weeks before deciding.
My Personal Recommendation (based on what you‚Äôve shared):
If you're doing well academically and want to keep your options open, STX or HTX could be very strong
choices. But if you're more hands-on or want to start working earlier, EUX gives a great balance of both
theory and practice.

HHX (Handelsgymnasium) ‚Äì Focuses on business, economics, and international studies. Great if
you're curious about business or global issues.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium) ‚Äì Focused on science, technology, and engineering. Ideal if you like
practical science and tech subjects.
HF ‚Äì A shorter (2-year) academic program, more Ô¨Çexible, often for slightly older students or those
seeking a diÔ¨Äerent pace. Less math-heavy than the others.
Recommended if:
You enjoy academic subjects
You might want to go to university later
You‚Äôre unsure exactly what you want yet ‚Äî this keeps your options open

schools. Great if you‚Äôre thinking globally, maybe studying abroad later.
Recommended if:
You want a break from traditional school

Here are some personalized suggestions:
1. If you enjoy academic learning and are open to university in the futur e:
STX is a solid, Ô¨Çexible option. You can choose focus areas (studieretninger) like science,
languages, or social studies.
Consider HTX if you like math, IT, or science/tech. It‚Äôs great for STEM careers.
2. If you're interested in business, international culture, or possibly working with something
related to Korea or international relations:
HHX is ideal. It emphasizes economics, marketing, and languages.
3. If you like practical skills but also want academic qualiÔ¨Åcations:
EUX can give you both vocational skills and the ability to go to university later.
üîπ Bonus: Take Advantage of Your Background
Language & Culture: If you speak or want to learn Korean well, that‚Äôs a unique strength.

Sudan,"Uddannelsesvalg efter folkeskole
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Sudan. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thanks for sharing your background! Since you‚Äôve just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and you're
thinking about your next step, this is a really important (but Ô¨Çexible!) moment in your life. In Denmark,
after primary/lower secondary school (folkeskole), you generally have a few main paths to choose from,
depending on your interests, strengths, and career goals.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the main options and some recommendations tailored to your situation:
üîπ 1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These are the most common next step for students aiming for higher education (university or similar).
You‚Äôd typically choose this if you enjoy academic subjects and want to keep your options open.
Main types:
STX (Alment gymnasium) ‚Äì Broad academic program; strong in humanities, science, and social
studies.
HHX (Handelsskole) ‚Äì Focus on business, economics, and marketing.
HTX (Teknisk gymnasium) ‚Äì Focus on technology, natural sciences, and IT.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen) ‚Äì A bit shorter (2 years), often more Ô¨Çexible; good for older
students or those who want a faster route to higher education.
‚úÖ Recommendation:
If you enjoy school subjects like math, science, languages, or social studies and are considering
university later on, STX or HTX might suit you well. If you're more into business or entrepreneurship,
HHX could be ideal.
üîπ 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì EUD)
This is a great choice if you prefer learning through practical work and want to get a job sooner. You can
become a skilled worker (e.g. electrician, carpenter, chef, healthcare worker, etc.).
‚úÖ Recommendation:
If you‚Äôre hands-on and want to start working earlier (or earn while learning), a vocational path could be
great. You can still move on to higher education later with a eux-forl√∏b, which combines vocational
training with academic studies.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2üîπ 3. Kombinationsforl√∏b (EUX)
This combines vocational training and general upper secondary education. It‚Äôs a bit demanding, but
gives you both a trade and the option to go to university.
‚úÖ Recommendation:
If you‚Äôre ambitious and want Ô¨Çexibility (work and study options), EUX is an excellent middle path.
‚ùìQuestions to ask yourself:
Do I enjoy academic schoolwork?
Do I prefer hands-on, practical tasks?
Am I thinking about university?
Do I want to start working soon and be Ô¨Ånancially independent?
üåç Other Things to Consider:
Being bilingual and bicultural is a huge strength ‚Äì Ô¨Åelds like healthcare, education, social work,
and translation can beneÔ¨Åt from that.
There are support programs and student counseling (Studievalg Danmark) that help you make
the right choice ‚Äì you can talk to a vejleder for free.
Don‚Äôt worry about locking yourself in ‚Äì the Danish system is very Ô¨Çexible. You can change your
path later.
Final Suggestion:
If you‚Äôre not 100% sure yet, go for a broad academic option like STX ‚Äì it gives you time and Ô¨Çexibility. If
you already have a strong interest (like business or tech), then HHX or HTX might be better. If you‚Äôre
eager to get working and learn a craft, EUD or EUX are strong options.

Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark (folkeskolen), you're at a key transition point in the Danish
education system. Here are your main options and some guidance based on your situation:
üéì 1. Gymnasiale Uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)
These are academic tracks that prepare you for university.
a. STX (Studentereksamen)
Broad general education.
Strong focus on humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.
Good if you're unsure what you want to study later ‚Äî it keeps your options open.
b. HTX (Teknisk Gymnasium)
Focus on technology and natural sciences.
Great if you're into science, engineering, or tech-related subjects.
c. HHX (Handelsgymnasium)
Focus on business, economics, and marketing.
Good if you're interested in entrepreneurship, international trade, or economics.
d. HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen)
A 2-year option (vs. the 3 years of the others).
Slightly more mature environment.
Often taken by students who want a faster route to professions like teaching, nursing, or social
work.
üõ† 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training, EUD)
Combines school with internships (praktik) in companies.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Leads directly to skilled jobs (e.g. electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, IT technician, etc.).
Shorter path to employment and good if you like hands-on work or know what job you're aiming
for.
üß† Choosing the Right Path
Here are some questions to help narrow it down:
Do you enjoy studying theory (reading, writing, exams), or prefer learning by doing?
Are there speciÔ¨Åc subjects or careers you're passionate about (e.g. medicine, business, design,
engineering, helping others)?
Do you want to go to university later, or start working sooner?
‚úÖ My Suggestion (based on your age and background)
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born and raised in Denmark, and just Ô¨Ånished primary school, you're in a
good position to succeed in the gymnasiale path. If you're not sure exactly what to do yet, STX is often
the best general option ‚Äî it keeps doors open. If you're more practically inclined or already have a
career goal, EUD can be a faster and very respected route to a job.
üí¨ Final Tip:
Most schools oÔ¨Äer studievejledning (study counseling). Talk to a guidance counselor ‚Äî they can help
you understand your local options, and even arrange ‚Äúbrobygning‚Äù (bridge programs) to try diÔ¨Äerent
paths before choosing.
Would you like a list of career ideas or school types near where you live? I can help with that too.

Some people also use 10th grade to focus on a subject like math, Danish, or English if they want to
qualify for a speciÔ¨Åc upper secondary program.

Here are a few questions to help you decide:
Do you enjoy schoolwork and academic subjects?
Do you have a dream job or Ô¨Åeld already (e.g. doctor, engineer, businessperson, mechanic)?
Do you prefer practical, hands-on learning or classroom study?

üéì Main Educational Paths in Denmark After Primary School
After completing Folkeskolen (primary and lower secondary education), students typically choose
between these main paths:
1. General Upper Secondary Education (Gymnasiale Uddannelser)
These are academically focused and prepare you for university.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad academic focus (humanities, sciences, languages). Great if
you're unsure or want to keep your options open.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, and marketing.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen): Focus on technology and natural sciences.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): Shorter, more practical academic path (2 years). Suitable if
you're a bit older or prefer more applied learning.
‚úÖ Good Ô¨Åt if:
You enjoy academic subjects.
You're considering university later.
You want to explore broad topics before specializing.
2. Vocational Education and Training (EUD - Erhvervsuddannelse)
This path combines school with hands-on training in a company (apprenticeship). Lasts 3-5 years.
Examples: Electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, IT-supporter, social care assistant, chef, etc.
Leads directly to a job, but can also give access to certain higher education options.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/3‚úÖ Good Ô¨Åt if:
You prefer practical, hands-on work.
You want to start earning earlier.
You're interested in trades, crafts, or speciÔ¨Åc professions.
3. Combined Youth Education (FGU - Forberedende Grunduddannelse)
This is for those who need more time to be ready for further education or training (e.g., to strengthen
Danish or other skills).
‚úÖ Good Ô¨Åt if:
You‚Äôre unsure of your path.
You want a second chance at deciding or improving grades/skills.
üß≠ How to Choose? Ask Yourself:
Do I enjoy academic work (reading, writing, theory)?
Am I curious about science, society, business, or technology?
Would I rather be hands-on, building or creating things?
Do I want to go to university, or start working sooner?
üß† My Suggestion (Based on What You‚Äôve Shared)
Since:
You‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish,
You've completed primary school in Denmark,
You come from a multicultural background (Danish-Ukrainian),
You're at a decision point now,
I'd suggest starting with STX or HTX if you like academic work and want to keep your university options
open. If you're more practical and want to start a profession sooner, a vocational education (EUD) could
be a strong path‚Äîespecially if you're drawn to technology, service industries, or skilled trades.
üí° Bonus Tip:
If you have strong bilingual skills (e.g., Danish, Ukrainian, maybe even Russian or English), you could
consider areas where languages, international understanding, or cultural knowledge are valuable‚Äîlike
diplomacy, translation, international business, or education.
If you tell me more about your interests (e.g., favorite subjects, hobbies, what you‚Äôre curious about), I
can help you make an even more tailored plan.

recently Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark. At 16, you're at a key point where your next step can help
shape both your personal and professional futur e. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of your options in Denmark,
along with some guidance based on your situation:
üéì Main Educational Paths in Denmark After Primary School
After completing Folkeskolen (primary and lower secondary education), students typically choose
between these main paths:
1. General Upper Secondary Education (Gymnasiale Uddannelser)
These are academically focused and prepare you for university.
STX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad academic focus (humanities, sciences, languages). Great if
you're unsure or want to keep your options open.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen): Focus on business, economics, and marketing.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen): Focus on technology and natural sciences.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen): Shorter, more practical academic path (2 years). Suitable if
you're a bit older or prefer more applied learning.
‚úÖ Good Ô¨Åt if:
You enjoy academic subjects.
You're considering university later.
You want to explore broad topics before specializing.
2. Vocational Education and Training (EUD - Erhvervsuddannelse)
This path combines school with hands-on training in a company (apprenticeship). Lasts 3-5 years.
Examples: Electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, IT-supporter, social care assistant, chef, etc.
Leads directly to a job, but can also give access to certain higher education options.
‚úÖ Good Ô¨Åt if:
You prefer practical, hands-on work.
You want to start earning earlier.
You're interested in trades, crafts, or speciÔ¨Åc professions.
3. Combined Youth Education (FGU - Forberedende Grunduddannelse)
This is for those who need more time to be ready for further education or training (e.g., to strengthen
Danish or other skills).
‚úÖ Good Ô¨Åt if:
You‚Äôre unsure of your path.
You want a second chance at deciding or improving grades/skills.
üß≠ How to Choose? Ask Yourself:
Do I enjoy academic work (reading, writing, theory)?
Am I curious about science, society, business, or technology?
Would I rather be hands-on, building or creating things?
Do I want to go to university, or start working sooner?
üß† My Suggestion (Based on What You‚Äôve Shared)
Since:
You‚Äôre Ô¨Çuent in Danish,
You've completed primary school in Denmark,
You come from a multicultural background (Danish-Ukrainian),
You're at a decision point now,
I'd suggest starting with STX or HTX if you like academic work and want to keep your university options
open. If you're more practical and want to start a profession sooner, a vocational education (EUD) could
be a strong path‚Äîespecially if you're drawn to technology, service industries, or skilled trades.
üí° Bonus Tip:
If you have strong bilingual skills (e.g., Danish, Ukrainian, maybe even Russian or English), you could
consider areas where languages, international understanding, or cultural knowledge are valuable‚Äîlike
diplomacy, translation, international business, or education.
If you tell me more about your interests (e.g., favorite subjects, hobbies, what you‚Äôre curious about), I
can help you make an even more tailored plan.

Translation, diplomacy, or education (STX)
Tourism or hospitality (vocational)
‚úÖ My General Suggestion:
If you‚Äôre unsure but open to university later, and you have decent grades, STX is a Ô¨Çexible and
respected choice.
But if you're more practical, enjoy working hands-on, and want to earn earlier, a vocational education
can be a strong and smart option too ‚Äî Denmark values skilled workers highly.

Uzbekistan,"Uddannelsesvalg i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from 
Uzbekistan. I just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step 
should be. I'm Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thanks for sharing a bit about yourself ‚Äî that's a great place to start. Since you're in Denmark, have
Ô¨Ånished primary school, and are Ô¨Çuent in Danish, you're in a good position with a few solid options
ahead of you. The next step after primary school (folkeskole) is usually youth education
(ungdomsuddannelse), and there are two main directions:
üéì 1. General Upper Secondary Education (Gymnasiale uddannelser)
This is a good choice if you're considering going to university later.
Main options:
STX (Studentereksamen): Broad and academic, with both sciences, humanities, and social studies.
HHX (Handelsh√∏jskoleeksamen): Focused on business, economics, and international trade.
HTX (Teknisk eksamen): Focused on technology, science, and innovation.
HF (H√∏jere Forberedelseseksamen): A shorter, 2-year version, often for those who need a more
practical approach or want to enter social/health-related Ô¨Åelds.
üëâ Choose this route if you're interested in subjects like science, language, business, or social science
and want to keep university open as an option.
üîß 2. Vocational Education and Training (Erhvervsuddannelser - EUD)
This path is more hands-on and job-focused. It mixes school and work experience (praktikplads) and can
lead directly to a career.
Examples:
Electrician, carpenter, chef, mechanic, IT technician, health care worker, etc.
Some programs also let you qualify for university later (via EUX, which combines EUD with more
academic subjects).
üëâ Choose this if you enjoy working practically and want to get into the job market earlier ‚Äî or if you
have a speciÔ¨Åc trade or profession in mind.
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2‚ùì How to Decide?
Here are some questions to ask yourself:
Do I like studying academically, or do I prefer practical work?
Do I want to go to university one day, or start working sooner?
What subjects do I enjoy the most?
Am I interested in a speciÔ¨Åc career already?
üó∫ A Personal Strategy
Since you're Ô¨Çuent in Danish, born and raised in Denmark, and come from a multicultural background,
you have some great advantages:
You could succeed well in STX or HHX, especially if you enjoy languages, social science, or
business.
If you‚Äôre more practical, a EUX might be great ‚Äî you get a trade and can still go to university later.
You can also take advantage of career counseling (UU-vejledning), which is free and available to
all students in Denmark.
‚úÖ Final Thought
At 16, you don‚Äôt have to decide your whole futur e yet ‚Äî just take the next step that keeps your options
open and Ô¨Åts your interests. If you‚Äôre unsur e, STX or EUX are good Ô¨Çexible choices that combine broad
learning with future opportunities.
If you tell me more about your interests (e.g., subjects you like, career ideas), I can help narrow down
the best match.

Zambia,"Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark
I'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Zambia. I 
just Ô¨Ånished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm 
Ô¨Çuent in danish.
What educational path would you recommend for me?
Thanks for sharing that ‚Äî you're in an important moment of transition, and it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre
thinking carefully about your next steps. Since you're 16 and just Ô¨Ånished primary/lower secondary
school (folkeskolen) in Denmark, you have several strong educational paths available. What‚Äôs best for
you depends on your interests, strengths, and goals.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of your main options in Denmark:
üìö 1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
These are 3-year programs that prepare you for university.
Options:
STX (Almen studentereksamen) ‚Äì broad academic program with a mix of humanities, science,
and social science.
HHX (H√∏jere handelseksamen) ‚Äì business-focused, good if you're interested in economics,
marketing, or international business.
HTX (H√∏jere teknisk eksamen) ‚Äì technical and science-focused, ideal if you like engineering,
technology, or natural sciences.
HF (H√∏jere forberedelseseksamen) ‚Äì a shorter 2-year option (often for more mature students or
those who want to go to uni quicker).
Recommended if: You‚Äôre academically inclined and might want to go to university later.
üîß 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì EUD)
This combines school with apprenticeships in real workplaces.
Examples of paths:
Electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, chef, healthcare worker, IT support, etc.
Recommended if: You like hands-on learning and want to work and earn while you study.
üí° 3. EUX ‚Äì A Combination Path
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2This mixes EUD and STX-level academics, letting you both learn a trade and get qualiÔ¨Åcations for
university.
Recommended if: You want the Ô¨Çexibility of doing vocational work but also want to keep the
door open for university.
üß† Things to Consider
Ask yourself:
Do I enjoy studying academic subjects like science, languages, or history?
Do I prefer learning by doing ‚Äî with practical tasks?
Would I rather start working sooner, or do I want to go to university?
Do I have a passion like business, technology, arts, or healthcare?
üåç Your Background
Being bilingual, bicultural, and from a Zambian family could be a strength in many areas:
International business (HHX)
Health and social care (EUD or STX with social science focus)
Global development or politics (STX or HF)
üéØ A Simple Recommendation:
If you're not sure what you want yet, going to STX is a safe and Ô¨Çexible option. It keeps your university
options open and gives you time to Ô¨Ågure out what you‚Äôre passionate about.
But if you‚Äôre more into doing things practically and earning a wage during your studies, then EUX is a
great combo route.
Would you like me to suggest a speciÔ¨Åc school or program near your location in Denmark? Or tell me
more about your interests and I can tailor the recommendation even more.

Thanks for sharing a bit about your background‚Äîthat‚Äôs helpful context. Since you just Ô¨Ånished primary
school in Denmark (folkeskolen), you‚Äôre at a key decision point. In Denmark, you have a few main
educational paths to consider, depending on your interests, strengths, and long-term goals. Here‚Äôs a
breakdown with suggestions based on diÔ¨Äerent directions:
üéì 1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (General Upper Secondary Education)
These are great if you're academically strong and maybe thinking about university later.
Options:
STX (Studentereksamen): Broad and academic. Includes humanities, social sciences, and natural
sciences. Good if you're not sure exactly what you want yet.
HHX (Higher Commercial Examination): Focus on business, economics, and marketing. Ideal if
you're interested in business or starting a company.
HTX (Higher Technical Examination): Focus on science, technology, and engineering. Great for
tech-savvy or STEM-interested students.

üìå Recommended if: You enjoy school, want more academic subjects, and are possibly aiming for
university.
üõ† 2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET)
These are practical and lead directly to skilled jobs. You split time between school and a paid
apprenticeship in a company.
Examples:
Electrician, mechanic, carpenter, chef, hairdresser, social/health care worker, IT support.
You can still continue to higher education afterwards if you want (e.g., via EUX ‚Äì a combined VET
and academic path).
Printed using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2üìå Recommended if: You want hands-on learning and to start earning earlier. Also good if you‚Äôre not so
into traditional academic schoolwork.
üé® 3. Other specialized schools
Efterskole: If you‚Äôd like to spend a year developing yourself socially and personally, while studying
subjects you‚Äôre passionate about (like music, sports, or global citizenship).
International or IB programs: If you want to study in English and have a more international
outlook. Might be appealing given your Zimbabwean heritage and Ô¨Çuency in Danish.
ü§î So, what should you choose?

later on
Are you interested in business, Ô¨Ånance, or running your own company? Look at HHX

üåç Bonus tip:

insight and bilingualism in areas like international business, diplomacy, global health, or NGO work.
