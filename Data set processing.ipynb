Many companies and organizations value people who can work across cultures and\nlanguages — you might want to keep that in mind whatever path you pick.\nIf you tell me a bit more — for example:\nyour favorite subjects\nwhether you like practical or theoretical learning\nany hobbies or future dream jobs\n—I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.\nShall we? 😊\n",

I'm ﬂuent in danish.\nWhat educational path would you recommend for me?\nThank you for sharing — that helps a lot. Since you’re 16, ﬁnished primary school in Denmark, ﬂuent in\nDanish, and have Bosnian heritage, you have quite a few good options depending a bit on your\ninterests, goals, and personality. Let me lay out the main educational paths in Denmark, and then I can\ngive you a few tailored suggestions:\nMain Options After Primary School (Folkeskole)\n1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper secondary education - academic path):\nSTX (Almen studentereksamen) – Broad general education.\nHHX (Higher Commercial Examination) – Business and economics focus.\nHTX (Higher Technical Examination) – Technology, natural sciences, IT.\nHF (Higher Preparatory Examination) – Shorter, more practical academic path (2 years).\n2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education - EUD/EUX):\nYou train for a trade or profession (e.g. electrician, carpenter, IT support, health care).\nEUX combines vocational training with general upper secondary exams, so you can still go to\nuniversity later.\n3. International or bilingual programs (IB, for example):\nThese are usually taught in English, and may ﬁt well if you're thinking of studying abroad or an\ninternational career later.\nHow to decide?\nLet me ask you 3 quick questions (if you want to answer, I can give you a much more speciﬁc\nrecommendation):\n󾠮 Do you see yourself more academic (theory, books, university), or practical (hands-on, learning\nby doing, getting into a job sooner)?\n󾠯 Do you already have an area you're passionate about?

Recognized\nworldwide, including in Denmark.\nInternational schools: If you're thinking about studying abroad later, this could prepare you well.\n󾠱 Special Consideration: Your Bruneian Background\nDepending on your family's long-term plans:\nIf you might study or work in Brunei or Southeast Asia one day, it could be helpful to pick studies\nthat include international business, languages, or intercultural communication.\nDenmark has many globalized educational tracks that could ﬁt this nicely.\nMy personal suggestion (based on what you’ve told me)\nIf you're unsure right now, STX or IB would give you the most ﬂexibility. They open doors to many\ndiﬀerent careers and let you ﬁnd your interests along the way. You’re still young — it’s okay not to know\nyet.\n👉 If you tell me a bit more (for example:\nDo you like science, business, languages, or something else?\nDo you think you want to go to university someday?\nDo you want to stay in Denmark or consider studying abroad?)\n... then I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.\nShall we go a bit deeper? 😊\n",

I'll break it\ndown simply:\n󾠮 Gymnasiale uddannelser (General upper secondary education)\nIf you're not 100% sure yet what career you want, but you enjoy academic subjects and might want to go\nto university later, this is often a good choice.\nSTX (Almen studentereksamen)\nFocus: broad academic education — languages, science, humanities, social science.\nGood if you want to keep many doors open.\nHHX (Handelsgymnasiet)\nFocus: business, economics, marketing, international trade.\nGood if you're interested in business, ﬁnance, or entrepreneurship.\nHTX (Teknisk gymnasium)\nFocus: technology, science, IT, engineering.\nGood if you're into STEM ﬁelds (engineering, IT, natural sciences).\nHF (Højere Forberedelseseksamen)\nShorter (2 years).\nMore practice-oriented, but still gives university access.\nOften good if you prefer a more mature study environment or want a shorter academic path.\n󾠯 EUD / EUX (Vocational education and training)\nIf you would prefer something more hands-on and career-oriented directly after primary school:\nEUD (Erhvervsuddannelse)\nYou learn a trade, e.g. electrician, mechanic, hairdresser, chef, carpenter, etc.\nYou combine school with apprenticeship.\nEUX\nCombines vocational training with academic courses — you get both a trade qualiﬁcation and a\nhigher education entrance qualiﬁcation.\nVery strong option if you want practical skills but still want the option to continue studying later.\n󾠰 Special options based on your background\nSince your family is from Cabo Verde, you may also have unique language and cultural skills that could\nbe valuable in:\nInternational business\nTourism\nTranslation/interpreting\nDiplomacy / international relations\nIf you develop those interests, certain paths (HHX, STX with languages, or even EUX) could be especially\nuseful.\n󾠱 My personal recommendation based on what you've told me:\nSince you’re still quite open, ﬂuent in Danish, and have an international background, I would probably\nrecommend:\n👉 STX or HHX — unless you’re already strongly leaning towards a practical trade.\nIf you like subjects like languages, history, social science: STX.\nIf you like business, economics, entrepreneurship: HHX.\nBoth give you broad options for university later.\n👉 If you tell me a little more about your interests, I can make the recommendation even more\ntailored for you. For example:\nDo you like working with people, num bers, technology, or creativity?\nDo you imagine studying at university later?\nDo you want to start working as soon as possible?\nWould you like me to help you map a few possible \"life paths\" depending on your interests?\n",

I'm \nﬂuent in danish.\nWhat educational path would you recommend for me?\nExcellent — let’s break it down thoughtfully.\nYou're 16, Danish-born with Dominican roots, ﬂuent in Danish, just ﬁnished primary school (which in\nDenmark likely means folkeskole or similar).

Your options depend a bit on your interests, but\nhere’s a clear overview of your possibilities:\n󾠮 Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)\nThis is the most common route if you're interested in continuing general education and possibly going\nto university later. There are several types:\nSTX (Almen studentereksamen) — General upper secondary. Broadest option, strong for\nhumanities, sciences, and social sciences.\nHHX (Højere handelseksamen) — Business-oriented. Good if you're interested in business,\neconomics, marketing, international trade, etc.\nHTX (Højere teknisk eksamen) — Focused on technology, science, IT, and engineering.\nHF (Højere forberedelseseksamen) — A shorter 2-year option, good for some who want a slightly\nmore practical and ﬂexible route to higher education.\n💡 When to choose one of these?\nIf you like academic subjects.\nIf you might want to go to university.\nIf you’re still exploring and want to keep doors open.\n󾠯 Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET)\nThis is more hands-on, preparing you directly for a profession.\nEUD (Erhvervsuddannelse): Covers many ﬁelds like carpentry, electrician, hairdresser, cook,\nmechanic, health care assistant, etc.\nEUX: A hybrid where you get both vocational training and a general upper secondary diploma,\nallowing you to work or go to university.\nPrinted using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2💡 When to choose this?\nIf you like practical, hands-on work.\nIf you want to enter the workforce sooner.\nIf you want both vocational skills and the option for higher education.\n󾠰 Other possibilities\n10th grade (10. klasse) — Some take an extra year before upper secondary. Useful if you want\nmore time to ﬁgure things out, improve grades, or mature academically.\nInternational programs — Like IB (International Baccalaureate) if you're strong in English and\nwant an international diploma.\nPrivate programs / specialized schools — E.g. creative schools (design, music, etc.).\nMy recommendation (based on your info):\nSince you're bilingual, multicultural, and ﬂuent in Danish, you have an advantage in:\nInternational business\nSocial sciences\nLanguages\nTechnology (if you’re interested)\nIf you’re unsure:\nSTX or HHX is often a safe, broad choice that keeps many doors open.

There are diﬀerent types depending\non your interests:\nSTX (Alment Gymnasium) — general academic subjects (literature, history, sciences, languages).\nGreat if you're not sure yet.\nHHX (Handelsgymnasium) — focus on business, economics, marketing, and languages.\nHTX (Teknisk Gymnasium) — focus on technology, natural sciences, IT, and technical subjects.\nHF (Højere Forberedelseseksamen) — a bit shorter (2 years), more practical, good if you prefer\nless theory-heavy studies.\n✅ Best if: You want to keep doors open for university or higher education in Denmark or abroad.\n󾠯 Erhvervsuddannelse (VET / vocational training) — practical route\nIf you prefer hands-on learning and want to get a job more quickly, vocational education might be a\ngreat option.\nExamples: electrician, carpenter, chef, healthcare assistant, IT-supporter, etc.\nYou can still continue later to higher education via EUX (a combined vocational + academic route).\n✅ Best if: You like working with your hands or want a clear profession early.\n󾠰 International education\nSince you have Argentinian roots and are multilingual, you might also consider:\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB) — international diploma, opens doors worldwide.\nSome gymnasiums oﬀer IB in Denmark (e.g. Ørestad Gymnasium, Nørre Gymnasium, etc.).\n✅ Best if: You're interested in international studies, might want to study or work abroad.\nMy personal recommendation (based on your age and background):\nIf you enjoy studying and want to keep many doors open: consider STX or IB.\nIf you are interested in business or economics: HHX could be great.\nIf you enjoy technology, science, or engineering: HTX might ﬁt well.\nIf you prefer practical learning and getting a job sooner: vocational (EUD or EUX).\n👉 Bonus tip:\nIn Denmark, it’s very normal to be unsur e at your age. You can also try out 10. klasse or an efterskole for\na year if you need time to ﬁgure it out.\nIf you tell me a bit more about:\nyour interests (sciences? arts? tech? business? languages?)\nwhether you imagine studying at university one day\nor if you're more practical and like hands-on work\n…I can give you a much more speciﬁc recommendation.\nShall we?\n",

         "Uddannelsesmuligheder i Danmark\nI'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Bolivia. I \njust ﬁnished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm \nﬂuent in danish.\nWhat educational path would you recommend for me?\nThank you for sharing a bit about yourself — that helps a lot. You’re actually at a really good point right\nnow, because Denmark oﬀers quite a few options after primary school (9th or 10th grade). Since you're\nﬂuent in Danish and have your roots both in Denmark and Bolivia, you have even more opportunities.\nLet’s go through the main options — and I’ll give you a bit of personal advice depending on your\ninterests.\n󾠮 Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)\nThese are great if you want to keep many doors open for higher education later.\nSTX (Alment gymnasium): Broad academic focus: languages, social sciences, natural sciences,\narts.\nGood if you're not yet sure what you want to study.\nGives you access to all university programs.\nHHX (Handelsskole): Focus on business, economics, international trade.\nGreat if you're interested in business, marketing, or ﬁnance.\nAlso excellent if you might someday work internationally (your Bolivian roots could be an\nasset here).\nHTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technology, natural sciences, IT.\nGood if you enjoy subjects like math, physics, chemistry, biology, or programming.\nHF (Højere forberedelseseksamen): More practically oriented, 2-year program.\nGood if you want a shorter academic program, or if you're considering speciﬁc professional\nﬁelds afterward.\n󾠯 Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education and training / EUD)\nIf you want to get more hands-on experience and go directly into a trade or profession (e.g.\nelectrician, carpenter, healthcare worker, IT supporter).\nYou get a mix of school and apprenticeship (praktikplads).\nVery solid job opportunities afterward, and you can still build further education on top if you want.\n󾠰 International possibilities\nPrinted using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Since you have Bolivian roots and are ﬂuent in Danish, you could also consider eventua lly studying\nor working abroad. Starting with a gymnasium program with strong language components (e.g.\nSTX with Spanish or English focus, or even IB — International Baccalaureate if oﬀered near you)\nmight be a very strong foundation.\nMy general recommendation for you:\nIf you're not fully sure yet:\nSTX is usually a very safe and ﬂexible option. It keeps all your doors open for university and\nlets you explore diﬀerent areas.\nIf you’re more into business and languages:\nHHX might be a great ﬁt, especially if you think about working internationally one day.\nIf you're into science, technology or engineering:\nHTX could be ideal.\nIf you prefer a practical job early, and like working hands-on:\nEUD is a very good route, especially in Denmark where vocational training is highly respected.\n👉 A small personal tip:\nSince you're bilingual (Danish + likely Spanish) and live in Denmark, your language skills are a big\nadvantage. Many companies and organizations value people who can work across cultures and\nlanguages — you might want to keep that in mind whatever path you pick.\nIf you tell me a bit more — for example:\nyour favorite subjects\nwhether you like practical or theoretical learning\nany hobbies or future dream jobs\n—I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.\nShall we? 😊\nPrinted using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 2/2",

Since you're\nﬂuent in Danish and have your roots both in Denmark and Bolivia, you have even more opportunities.\nLet’s go through the main options — and I’ll give you a bit of personal advice depending on your\ninterests.\n󾠮 Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)\nThese are great if you want to keep many doors open for higher education later.\nSTX (Alment gymnasium): Broad academic focus: languages, social sciences, natural sciences,\narts.\nGood if you're not yet sure what you want to study.\nGives you access to all university programs.\nHHX (Handelsskole): Focus on business, economics, international trade.\nGreat if you're interested in business, marketing, or ﬁnance.\nAlso excellent if you might someday work internationally (your Bolivian roots could be an\nasset here).\nHTX (Teknisk gymnasium): Focus on technology, natural sciences, IT.\nGood if you enjoy subjects like math, physics, chemistry, biology, or programming.\nHF (Højere forberedelseseksamen): More practically oriented, 2-year program.\nGood if you want a shorter academic program, or if you're considering speciﬁc professional\nﬁelds afterward.\n󾠯 Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational education and training / EUD)\nIf you want to get more hands-on experience and go directly into a trade or profession (e.g.\nelectrician, carpenter, healthcare worker, IT supporter).\nYou get a mix of school and apprenticeship (praktikplads).\nVery solid job opportunities afterward, and you can still build further education on top if you want.\n󾠰 International possibilities\nSince you have Bolivian roots and are ﬂuent in Danish, you could also consider eventua lly studying\nor working abroad. Starting with a gymnasium program with strong language components (e.g.\nSTX with Spanish or English focus, or even IB — International Baccalaureate if oﬀered near you)\nmight be a very strong foundation.\nMy general recommendation for you:\nIf you're not fully sure yet:\nSTX is usually a very safe and ﬂexible option. It keeps all your doors open for university and\nlets you explore diﬀerent areas.\nIf you’re more into business and languages:\nHHX might be a great ﬁt, especially if you think about working internationally one day.\nIf you're into science, technology or engineering:\nHTX could be ideal.\nIf you prefer a practical job early, and like working hands-on:\nEUD is a very good route, especially in Denmark where vocational training is highly respected.\n👉 A small personal tip:\nSince you're bilingual (Danish + likely Spanish) and live in Denmark, your language skills are a big\nadvantage. Many companies and organizations value people who can work across cultures and\nlanguages — you might want to keep that in mind whatever path you pick.\nIf you tell me a bit more — for example:\nyour favorite subjects\nwhether you like practical or theoretical learning\nany hobbies or future dream jobs\n—I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.\nShall we? 😊\n",

Ideal if you like technology, IT, or\nengineering.\nHF (Højere forberedelseseksamen) – shorter, more practical, easier access to certain professions\n(nursing, teaching, etc.).\n👉 Best if you enjoy studying, want to keep doors open, and maybe consider university later.\n󾠯 EUD (Erhvervsuddannelse) – Vocational Education and Training\nIf you want to learn a profession more practically and maybe start earning sooner, Denmark has strong\nvocational programs:\nExamples: electrician, carpenter, hairdresser, chef, healthcare worker, IT support, etc.\nYou combine school and internships (praktikplads).\n👉 Best if you like hands-on learning, want a skilled trade, or want to enter the job market earlier.\n󾠰 EUX (Erhvervsfaglig studentereksamen) – Combination of vocational and\nacademic\nMixes vocational training with academic studies.\nGives you both a skilled trade and the option for further education later.\n👉 Best if you want a skilled trade but still want the option to go to university later.\n󾠱 International or Specialized Schools\nGiven your background and ﬂuency in Danish (and possibly other languages), you might also consider:\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nPrivate or specialized schools with international focus.\n👉 Best if you're strong in English, thinking internationally, or might want to study/work abroad.\nA Few Personal Questions (if you're okay answering):\nWhat subjects do you enjoy most?\nDo you see yourself more in academic studies or practical work?\nAre you thinking more about university or getting a profession earlier?\nDo you have any interests already (technology, healthcare, business, etc.)?\n👉 If you tell me a little more, I can give you a much more personalized recommendation.

(e.g. exchange programs, languages, travel)\nDo you want to keep doors open for university?\n󾠱 My preliminary recommendation (since you haven’t given details yet):\nIf you're not sure yet →\nSTX (Studentereksamen) is usually the safest, most ﬂexible choice.\n3 years.\nPrepares you for almost any university study in Denmark or abroad.\nOﬀers many diﬀerent study lines: science, social science, languages, arts.\nYou can take Spanish as a subject — huge bonus given your Chilean background.\nKeeps doors open while you ﬁgure out your interests.\n󾠲 Other good options depending on your interests:\nIf you're more practically minded →  EUX can give you both vocational skills and a pathway to\nuniversity.\nIf you're very interested in international perspectives →  consider an IB (International\nBaccalaureate) program. Some Danish schools oﬀer this in English.\nIf you're highly focused on business or tech →  HHX (Higher Commercial Examination) or HTX\n(Higher Technical Examination).\n󾠳 Your Chilean background is a strength:\nSpanish + Danish ﬂuency = highly valuable.\nCan open doors to international business, diplomacy, translation, tourism, international\norganizations.\nConsider developing strong English too.\n👉 If you tell me a bit more — like what subjects you enjoy, or what careers you imagine — I can\ngive a much more speciﬁc recommendation.\nShall we go a bit deeper?\n",

Let’s break it down:\nThe 3 Main Educational Paths After Folkeskole in Denmark:\n1. Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)\nIf you're interested in general academic education and perhaps aiming for university later, you can\nconsider:\nSTX (Almen studentereksamen): Broad, academic, with focus on humanities, science, and\nsocial studies.\nHHX (Higher Commercial Examination Programme): Focus on business, economics,\ninternational trade, and languages.\nHTX (Higher Technical Examination Programme): Focus on technology, science, and\ninnovation.\nHF (Higher Preparatory Examination Programme): A bit shorter (2 years), often a good ﬁt if\nyou want a more practical or ﬂexible approach to university eligibility.\n2. Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD/EUX)\nIf you're more practically oriented and would like to enter the job market earlier or get hands-on\ntraining:\nTrades (plumber, electrician, carpenter, etc.)\nHealth care assistant\nOﬃce work, retail, etc.\nWith EUX you can combine vocational training with academic studies, giving you both a trade\nqualiﬁcation and eligibility for higher education.\n3. 10th Grade (if you're unsure and want more time to decide)\nSome students take 10th grade to mature academically or personally before choosing the next\nstep.\nYou can do 10th grade at a regular school, efterskole, or special 10th grade programs.\nA Few Personal Considerations\nPrinted using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2Do you enjoy studying?\nIf yes →  consider STX, HHX, HTX, HF.\nIf not so much →  consider vocational training (EUD/EUX) or 10th grade ﬁrst.\nDo you have career dreams already?\nDoctor, lawyer, teacher →  STX or HF.\nEngineer, IT, biotech →  HTX.\nBusiness, marketing, ﬁnance →  HHX.\nSkilled trade, health care, craftsmanshi p →  EUD/EUX.\nDo you want to work internationally one day?\nHHX or STX with language studies could help you.\nDo you want to work sooner?\nVocational training may get you into work faster.\nMy honest recommendation (based on your age and situation):\nSince you just ﬁnished primary school and are ﬂuent in Danish, you’re in a strong position. Unless you\nhave a clear idea for vocational training, I would recommend:\n➡ Go for one of the gymnasiale uddannelser (STX, HHX, HTX or HF)\nThis keeps many doors open for you.

Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - EUD/EUX)\nIf you're more practically oriented and would like to enter the job market earlier or get hands-on\ntraining:\nTrades (plumber, electrician, carpenter, etc.)\nHealth care assistant\nOﬃce work, retail, etc.\nWith EUX you can combine vocational training with academic studies, giving you both a trade\nqualiﬁcation and eligibility for higher education.\n3. 10th Grade (if you're unsure and want more time to decide)\nSome students take 10th grade to mature academically or personally before choosing the next\nstep.\nYou can do 10th grade at a regular school, efterskole, or special 10th grade programs.\nA Few Personal Considerations\nDo you enjoy studying?\nIf yes →  consider STX, HHX, HTX, HF.\nIf not so much →  consider vocational training (EUD/EUX) or 10th grade ﬁrst.\nDo you have career dreams already?\nDoctor, lawyer, teacher →  STX or HF.\nEngineer, IT, biotech →  HTX.\nBusiness, marketing, ﬁnance →  HHX.\nSkilled trade, health care, craftsmanshi p →  EUD/EUX.\nDo you want to work internationally one day?\nHHX or STX with language studies could help you.\nDo you want to work sooner?\nVocational training may get you into work faster.\nMy honest recommendation (based on your age and situation):\nSince you just ﬁnished primary school and are ﬂuent in Danish, you’re in a strong position. Unless you\nhave a clear idea for vocational training, I would recommend:\n➡ Go for one of the gymnasiale uddannelser (STX, HHX, HTX or HF)\nThis keeps many doors open for you. You can always switch direction later.\n👉 If you tell me a bit more about:\nYour interests (math, languages, business, IT, science, people…?)\nYour grades (are you generally strong in school?)\nYour long-term dreams (university? job? business?)\n…I can give you a much more tailored recommendation.\nShall we? 😊\n",

         "Uddannelsesmuligheder efter folkeskole\nI'm a 16 year old person living in Denmark. I'm born in Denmark, but my parents are from Dominica. \nI just ﬁnished primary school in Denmark and am now considering what my next step should be. I'm \nﬂuent in danish.\nWhat educational path would you recommend for me?\nExcellent — let’s break it down thoughtfully.\nYou're 16, Danish-born with Dominican roots, ﬂuent in Danish, just ﬁnished primary school (which in\nDenmark likely means folkeskole or similar). Now you stand right at the typical point where Danish\nstudents choose between several educational paths. Your options depend a bit on your interests, but\nhere’s a clear overview of your possibilities:\n󾠮 Gymnasiale uddannelser (Upper Secondary Education)\nThis is the most common route if you're interested in continuing general education and possibly going\nto university later. There are several types:\nSTX (Almen studentereksamen) — General upper secondary. Broadest option, strong for\nhumanities, sciences, and social sciences.\nHHX (Højere handelseksamen) — Business-oriented. Good if you're interested in business,\neconomics, marketing, international trade, etc.\nHTX (Højere teknisk eksamen) — Focused on technology, science, IT, and engineering.\nHF (Højere forberedelseseksamen) — A shorter 2-year option, good for some who want a slightly\nmore practical and ﬂexible route to higher education.\n💡 When to choose one of these?\nIf you like academic subjects.\nIf you might want to go to university.\nIf you’re still exploring and want to keep doors open.\n󾠯 Erhvervsuddannelser (Vocational Education and Training - VET)\nThis is more hands-on, preparing you directly for a profession.\nEUD (Erhvervsuddannelse): Covers many ﬁelds like carpentry, electrician, hairdresser, cook,\nmechanic, health care assistant, etc.\nEUX: A hybrid where you get both vocational training and a general upper secondary diploma,\nallowing you to work or go to university.\nPrinted using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 1/2💡 When to choose this?\nIf you like practical, hands-on work.\nIf you want to enter the workforce sooner.\nIf you want both vocational skills and the option for higher education.\n󾠰 Other possibilities\n10th grade (10. klasse) — Some take an extra year before upper secondary. Useful if you want\nmore time to ﬁgure things out, improve grades, or mature academically.\nInternational programs — Like IB (International Baccalaureate) if you're strong in English and\nwant an international diploma.\nPrivate programs / specialized schools — E.g. creative schools (design, music, etc.).\nMy recommendation (based on your info):\nSince you're bilingual, multicultural, and ﬂuent in Danish, you have an advantage in:\nInternational business\nSocial sciences\nLanguages\nTechnology (if you’re interested)\nIf you’re unsure:\nSTX or HHX is often a safe, broad choice that keeps many doors open. If you enjoy business or\ninternational aﬀairs, HHX might ﬁt you especially well. If you enjoy science or tech, HTX could be great.\nIf you prefer practical learning:\nEUX is a very smart option — you get a profession and a diploma for further studies.\n👉 If you tell me a bit more about:\nYour interests (subjects you like / dislike)\nWhether you prefer practical or academic work\nLong-term ideas (university? work? travel?)\n…I can give you a much more personalized recommendation.\nShall we ﬁne-tune it? 🚀\nPrinted using ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 2/2",
